# Operations and Deployment

## Runtime model

Production runs the built React application and Express server from one Node process.

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces:

- Vite client assets in `dist/`;
- bundled Express server at `dist/server.cjs`.

Start:

```bash
npm start
```

The server listens on `PORT` or defaults to `3000`.

## Production environment

Minimum application variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=sb_secret_...
```

The `VITE_*` values are compiled into the browser bundle. The secret key must never use the `VITE_` prefix.

## Google Sheets service account

For unattended spreadsheet sync, configure a Google service account.

Either:

```env
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={...json...}
```

or:

```env
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=...
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=...
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=...
```

Share the target spreadsheet with the service-account email and grant Editor access.

## Health checks

Use:

```text
GET /api/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

## GitHub Actions

### Quality Checks

File:

```text
.github/workflows/quality.yml
```

Triggers:

- push to `main`;
- pull request into `main`.

Runs:

1. dependency installation;
2. TypeScript typecheck;
3. Vitest;
4. production build.

### Historical Prices

File:

```text
.github/workflows/historical-prices.yml
```

Schedule:

```text
30 12 * * 0-4
```

This is Sunday through Thursday, matching normal EGX trading days.

Required repository secret:

```text
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY
```

Optional repository variable:

```text
EGX_PORTFOLIO_ID
```

The workflow uses the server secret only inside GitHub Actions.

### Intraday 1-minute market data

Primary workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/intraday-1m-sync.yml
```

The Premium implementation stages a five-minute ingestion cadence:

```text
*/5 7-12 * * 0-4
```

The cron is deliberately a broad UTC envelope. `scripts/syncIntradayOneMinute.ts` converts the run time through `Africa/Cairo` and only executes scheduled ingestion on Sunday-Thursday from 10:00 through the configured 14:40 Cairo post-close grace window. This avoids hardcoding a UTC+2 or UTC+3 assumption.

GitHub scheduled workflows execute from the repository default branch. Therefore the schedule in `feature/premium-ui-redesign` is staged until that work is intentionally promoted; do not treat a Premium-only cron edit as already active production scheduling.

The job:

1. discovers session-relevant portfolio tickers;
2. resolves ticker/canonical/ISIN identity;
3. retrieves missing/recent TradingView 1m observations in bounded batches;
4. inserts only missing raw 1m timestamps;
5. reloads persisted raw rows as the source of truth;
6. derives deterministic 5m buckets;
7. keeps only unreconstructible older legacy 5m bootstrap data;
8. prunes raw 1m >30d and derived 5m >90d;
9. emits per-ticker and final coverage diagnostics.

Manual run:

```bash
npm run sync:intraday:1m
```

Optional targeted/full-repair variables:

```env
EGX_INTRADAY_TICKERS=ACTF,NAPR
EGX_INTRADAY_FULL_REPAIR=true
```

Read-only diagnostic:

```bash
npm run diagnose:intraday:1m
```

### Legacy 5-minute repair

File:

```text
.github/workflows/intraday-prices.yml
```

This workflow is manual-only. It must not be reintroduced as a competing scheduled 5m producer while derived 5m is being generated from raw 1m.

Manual command:

```bash
npm run sync:intraday
```

Both intraday workflows use the same concurrency group so raw/derived migration and legacy repair cannot write concurrently.

See [INTRADAY_MARKET_DATA.md](INTRADAY_MARKET_DATA.md) and [INTRADAY_1M_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](INTRADAY_1M_MIGRATION_PLAN.md).

### EGX ticker registry

Authoritative security identity is maintained separately from quote snapshots:

```text
public.ticker_registry
public.ticker_aliases
```

The existing `public.tickers` table remains the price/technical snapshot table.

Workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/ticker-registry.yml
```

Manual command:

```bash
npm run sync:ticker-registry
```

The reconciliation job:

1. reads the TradingView Egypt Scanner universe;
2. keeps current live scanner symbols canonical;
3. normalizes ISIN-shaped scanner aliases back to a known ticker when evidence is unique;
4. refreshes identity/classification metadata;
5. detects renames only from previously scanner-verified identities sharing a unique ISIN;
6. verifies historical TradingView resolution and persists the successful symbol/method;
7. keeps inactive/retired identities for historical lookup;
8. emits active, alias, verification and unresolved counts.

Static aliases and the bundled dictionary are fallback/bootstrapping data only. They must not override a current registry identity.

Default policy:

```env
EGX_TICKER_VERIFY_LIMIT=100
EGX_TICKER_VERIFY_AFTER_DAYS=30
EGX_TICKER_INACTIVE_AFTER_DAYS=14
```

The Premium branch stages a post-session Sunday-Thursday registry schedule. As with the 1m workflow, GitHub scheduled workflows execute from the default branch, so this schedule is not production-active until Premium is intentionally promoted.

See [TICKER_REGISTRY.md](TICKER_REGISTRY.md).

### Production Data Audit

File:

```text
.github/workflows/production-data-audit.yml
```

Schedule:

```text
0 14 * * 0-4
```

Runs a read-only reconciliation/data-integrity audit.

## Historical-price operations

Manual run:

```bash
npm run sync:historical
```

Required:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=sb_secret_...
```

The historical sync:

- determines the portfolio/ticker universe;
- requests enough TradingView bars to cover the target calendar interval;
- filters results to exact requested dates;
- upserts historical rows without modifying accounting transactions.


### On-demand repair for missing portfolio history

The normal scheduled workflow remains the primary daily ingestion path. In addition, the application can repair a newly introduced ticker immediately when analytics detects that missing daily history is excluding valuation points.

Authenticated route:

```text
POST /api/supabase/price-history/ensure
```

The request contains only missing ticker targets and their first-transaction date hints. The server verifies the Supabase access token, checks the authenticated portfolio ledger, fetches TradingView daily bars, and inserts only absent `price_history` rows.

The endpoint is idempotent with respect to existing daily rows and does not mutate accounting state. It is intentionally triggered by analytics data-quality failures rather than on every chart render.

## Production audit

Manual run:

```bash
npm run verify:production-data
```

Use it after:

- a migration;
- duplicate cleanup;
- accounting code changes;
- unusual position/cash behavior;
- historical-price backfills.

The audit should not mutate portfolio accounting data.

## Data-change safety

Before any manual production correction:

1. identify the exact rows to change;
2. take a read-only before snapshot;
3. verify references from closed trades/positions;
4. perform the smallest possible mutation;
5. recompute/reconcile derived state if needed;
6. take an after snapshot;
7. run the production audit;
8. refresh/reopen the application to confirm persistence.

Never perform broad financial cleanup using an unreviewed similarity rule.

## Backups

The application contains JSON backup/reconcile functionality in the UI. A backup should be treated as a portable snapshot of financial state.

For important corrections, also capture database-side counts before and after:

- transactions;
- positions;
- closed trades;
- cash;
- capital deposits.

## PWA/service-worker deployments

Because the project is a PWA, clients can retain a previous application bundle.

After a deployment that changes authentication or persistence:

- hard refresh the page;
- verify the expected commit is deployed;
- if behavior remains stale, unregister the service worker and clear site data;
- reopen the app and authenticate again.

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Mobile access during development

The dev server binds to `0.0.0.0`, allowing LAN testing when firewall/network rules permit it.

For HTTPS testing on iOS, a temporary HTTPS tunnel may be used to forward to:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Supabase Auth does not require Firebase authorized-domain configuration.

## Legacy migration operations

The Firestore migration endpoint and scripts remain in the repository for historical/one-time use.

Keep:

```env
ENABLE_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_UI
```

unset or false in normal operation.

Do not rerun a migration against an already-live portfolio unless there is a documented recovery plan and a verified reconciliation target.


## Final analytics audit checks

Before promoting analytics changes, verify:

- transaction-ledger cash equals stored portfolio cash;
- transaction-derived shares equal stored positions;
- no exact duplicate non-cash transaction groups exist;
- all portfolio trades have execution timestamps when intraday analytics depend on them;
- every open holding has the latest daily market close;
- every open holding has intraday coverage for the latest completed session;
- final-session NAV from 15-minute closes agrees with stored portfolio market value.

The production RLS event-trigger function is intentionally not executable by browser API roles. The remaining Supabase security-advisor item at the time of the analytics audit is leaked-password protection, which should be enabled in Supabase Auth settings when available for the project.


## Intraday scheduler rollout and freshness

The September 28 audit confirmed that `main` still scheduled legacy 15m ingestion while `feature/premium-ui-redesign` contained the new 1m workflow. GitHub schedules use the default branch; deploying the web application alone does not activate the feature-branch schedule. Before declaring rollout complete, promote the reviewed Node ingestion workflow and dependencies to the default branch and retire the old scheduled producer. Do not move TradingView WebSockets into the Worker.

The reviewed schedule covers 07:00–13:59 UTC, gated by `Africa/Cairo` through 15:15 local time to accommodate delayed final candles and runner delays. Writers queue rather than cancelling a job mid-universe. GitHub cron is best-effort, not a one-minute service guarantee.

After promotion, inspect a scheduled run (not just a manual dispatch), verify current-session 1m coverage for held/session-traded tickers, and compare derived 5m OHLCV with raw aggregation. An active-session empty Today chart signals missing data; it no longer silently shows the preceding day. A manual 1m selection is strict; Auto may display 5m/15m for the same session when fine coverage is insufficient.

For a non-pruning repair, run `EGX_INTRADAY_SKIP_RETENTION=true npm run sync:intraday:1m` using server-side credentials. The September 28 repair completed successfully; see the dated audit report. No schema migration is required by this code patch.
