# Phase 6 — Mobile / Responsive Refinement Plan

**Status: COMPLETE — Pass 6 code audit, Quality Checks #745, and final real-device responsive smoke accepted.**

This is the detailed execution plan for Phase 6 of the premium UI redesign.

Phase 6 begins from the accepted Phase 5 state and is intentionally planned before implementation. The audit covered:

- `src/App.tsx`;
- all **33 non-test TSX files** under `src/components`;
- the current responsive/media-query layer in `src/index.css`;
- persistent shell, fixed notifications, modal/overlay families, filters/selectors, tables, report surfaces, and chart shells.

The goal is **not** to redesign navigation, charts, or information hierarchy. Phase 6 owns responsive fit, touch ergonomics, stacking, density, viewport safety, and reachability. Phase 6.5, 7, 8, and 9 retain their later ownership.

---

## 1. Audit summary

### 1.1 Existing strengths

The app is not starting from zero:

- `PositionsTable` already renders separate desktop-table and mobile-card layouts.
- Main content uses responsive page gutters (`px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`).
- Many headers/forms already stack at `sm`, `md`, or `lg`.
- Cash/report tables already use horizontal overflow containers.
- Several complex modals already use `overflow-y-auto`, `max-h-[90vh]`, or internal scrolling.
- Chart timeframe controls already scroll horizontally.
- Most report KPI grids already collapse from 4/6 columns down to 2 or 1.
- Phase 5 already provides lower-cost mobile material behavior.

Phase 6 should preserve these working patterns and standardize the weak ones.

### 1.2 Cross-cutting risks found

#### A. Touch targets are undersized across the shared control language

Many header actions, nav tabs, filter pills, compact selectors, icon controls, and quick-adjust buttons use `py-1` / `py-1.5` or very small icon padding.

Representative examples:
- Header actions/nav;
- Portfolio Summary sync/reconcile;
- Closed-cycle filters;
- Journal filters/pagination;
- chart timeframe segments;
- Quick Cash adjustment buttons;
- DateInput calendar trigger;
- modal close buttons.

`NumberStepperInput` is the strongest example: a 32px-wide control is split vertically into two buttons, producing very small individual touch targets.

**Phase 6 rule:** on coarse/touch pointers, interactive controls must receive a shared minimum target size without inflating desktop density.

#### B. Modal viewport behavior is inconsistent

Robust examples:
- Price Alerts: `max-h-[90vh]` + internal scrolling.
- Trade Screenshot: `max-h-[90vh]` + flex/internal scroll.
- Google Sheets: outer scrolling + inner max-height.
- Add Trade / Sell / Journal edit: scrolling backdrop.

Weak examples:
- Portfolio Backup is long and uses a centered fixed backdrop with no outer scrolling and no max-height contract.
- Edit Position, Quick Cash, Confirm Delete, and some embedded Cash modals rely on content fitting the viewport.
- Several modal paddings remain desktop-sized on narrow/short screens.

**Phase 6 rule:** every modal family gets a consistent `dvh`-aware viewport contract, safe outer padding, and predictable body/footer scrolling. Short content should still feel centered; long content must never clip.

#### C. Fixed notifications/status surfaces are not viewport-clamped

- App undo toast is fixed `bottom-6 right-6`.
- App notification toast is fixed `top-20 right-4`.
- Offline/Firestore status is fixed `bottom-4 left-4`.

None currently has a shared mobile width clamp/safe-area contract.

**Phase 6 rule:** fixed UI must use viewport-safe max widths and safe-area-aware insets.

#### D. Filter/search toolbars contain fixed minimum widths

Known hotspots:
- Closed Cycles search `min-w-[240px]`, sort `min-w-[205px]`.
- Positions sort `min-w-[170px]`.
- Ticker Directory selector `min-w-[170px]`.
- Trading Journal search `min-w-[240px]`, sort `170px`, page size `112px`.
- Monthly report selector `185px`.
- Trading Performance selector `165px`.

Most live inside wrapping/stacking containers, but fixed minimums still create risk at 320px and in nested padded cards.

**Phase 6 rule:** mobile uses `w-full/min-w-0` or bounded responsive widths; desktop minimums can remain where useful.

#### E. Report/chart shells fit, but controls/tooltips need a mobile contract

- Performance chart uses a horizontally scrolling timeframe row, but segments are compact touch targets.
- Primary chart tooltip uses `min-w-[260px]`.
- Allocation tooltip uses `min-w-[235px]`.
- Allocation chart uses fixed 285px height.
- Risk & Cost cards use fixed chart heights around 208–256px.
- Report export/print controls hide text correctly, but selector/action groups need narrow-screen review.

**Phase 6 rule:** preserve chart data/series/interpolation. Only responsive shell height, tooltip width, selector stacking, control reachability, and overflow are in scope. Phase 7 still owns chart visual design.

#### F. Mobile CSS currently optimizes effects, not layout ergonomics

`src/index.css` currently contains **six** `@media (max-width: 767px)` blocks, but they mainly tune:
- blur/material cost;
- hover/radial behavior;
- animation duration;
- report-glass intensity.

There is no canonical coarse-pointer touch-target layer, fixed-overlay width contract, or modal viewport primitive.

---

## 2. Responsive architecture

### 2.1 Viewport matrix

Every Phase 6 pass must consider at least:

- **320px narrow phone** — catches min-width/label overflow.
- **360px phone** — common Android baseline.
- **390px phone** — modern iPhone-class baseline.
- **430px large phone**.
- **768px tablet / breakpoint boundary**.
- **phone landscape / short viewport** — catches modal vertical clipping.

The goal is not pixel-perfect per device. These are stress cases for the responsive contract.

### 2.2 Shared responsive primitives before one-off fixes

Prefer shared CSS/media rules for recurring behavior:

1. **Touch-target contract**
   - coarse-pointer/mobile minimum control height;
   - icon-action minimum square target;
   - compact filter/segment target normalization;
   - preserve current desktop density.

2. **Modal viewport contract**
   - safe side/top/bottom padding;
   - `100dvh` / `calc(100dvh - ...)` maximums;
   - long body scroll;
   - no inaccessible footer/action row;
   - safe-area inset support where useful.

3. **Fixed-overlay contract**
   - `max-width: calc(100vw - gutters)`;
   - safe right/left/bottom/top positioning;
   - text can wrap rather than force overflow.

4. **Mobile control-width contract**
   - `min-width: 0` inside flex/grid;
   - selectors can become full-width where needed;
   - horizontal scrollers remain intentional only where the interaction benefits from them.

5. **Responsive chart/report shell rules**
   - tooltip width clamp;
   - chart height floors/ceilings;
   - selectors/actions wrap predictably;
   - no Phase 7 chart-style changes.

Do not solve repeated issues by adding unrelated per-component arbitrary widths if one shared rule can safely own the behavior.

## 3. Scope boundaries

### Phase 6 owns

- breakpoints;
- stacking/wrapping;
- mobile spacing/padding;
- viewport fit;
- touch target sizing;
- horizontal overflow containment;
- modal body/footer reachability;
- dropdown viewport containment;
- mobile table/card density;
- report/chart container sizing and selector fit;
- fixed toast/status positioning.

### Phase 6 does NOT own

- navigation information architecture or active-state redesign — **Phase 6.5**;
- chart colors, axes, plot styling, interpolation, series design — **Phase 7**;
- final visual hierarchy/typographic reprioritization — **Phase 8**;
- final header redesign/composition — **Phase 9**;
- business logic, accounting, persistence, transaction semantics, data engines.

Header/nav may receive touch/overflow fixes in Phase 6, but not structural redesign.

---

## 4. Component coverage matrix

Every render file has an explicit Phase 6 disposition.

### App shell / persistent surfaces

| File | Phase 6 disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `src/App.tsx` | **Direct.** Clamp undo/toast overlays to viewport; validate page gutters and top-level action rows at 320–430px. No tab lifecycle changes. |
| `Header.tsx` | **Direct.** Touch targets, wrap pressure, icon-only action usability, horizontal nav scroll containment. Structural nav/header redesign deferred to 6.5/9. |
| `PortfolioSummary.tsx` | **Direct.** Validate live-feed status wrapping, sync/reconcile action targets, 2-column KPI density at 320px. |
| `OfflineIndicator.tsx` | **Direct.** Viewport-safe fixed width/insets, text wrap, retry-action reachability. |

### Main data views

| File | Phase 6 disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `PositionsTable.tsx` | **Direct.** Preserve existing desktop/mobile split; fix toolbar selector widths/touch targets and mobile-card density/action reachability. |
| `ClosedCyclesView.tsx` | **Direct.** Remove mobile min-width pressure from search/sort; normalize filter strip behavior; verify card detail grids/actions. |
| `TradingJournal.tsx` | **Direct.** Toolbar/filter density, selector widths, pagination controls, fixed delete toast, card/action wrapping, edit modal viewport. |
| `CashBalanceView.tsx` | **Direct.** Table overflow affordance, action rows, edit/add modal viewport, two-column form compression, touch targets. |
| `TickerDirectoryView.tsx` | **Direct.** Search/select width contract and card metric density; preserve 1→2→3 column progression. |

### Reports and charts

| File | Phase 6 disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `PerformanceReports.tsx` | **Direct shell-only.** Allocation chart height/selector fit/tooltips and report-control wrapping. Chart design remains Phase 7. |
| `RealizedTrajectoryChart.tsx` | **Direct shell-only.** Selector/control target size, KPI grid density, mobile chart height. No series changes. |
| `charts/PerformanceTimeframeChart.tsx` | **Direct shell-only.** Timeframe scroller target size, mode dropdown containment, tooltip width, mobile chart height. Weekly/interpolation logic is frozen. |
| `charts/SecondaryAnalyticsCharts.tsx` | **Direct shell-only.** Card header stacking/value wrapping and mobile chart heights; no Recharts changes. |
| `charts/AnalyticsChartTheme.tsx` | **Direct shared tooltip/loading shell.** Clamp tooltip width for 320px; keep chart-theme redesign in Phase 7. |
| `reports/MonthlyPerformanceReport.tsx` | **Direct.** Selector/search/action rows, hero header wrapping, table horizontal access. |
| `reports/TradingPerformanceReport.tsx` | **Direct.** Selector/export controls, KPI density, report-table horizontal access. |

### Modal / overlay family

| File | Phase 6 disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `AddTradeModal.tsx` | **Direct.** Standard modal viewport contract; collapse narrow 2/3-column groups where needed; dropdown containment. |
| `EditPositionModal.tsx` | **Direct.** Add viewport-safe scrolling; prevent title/ticker/status overflow; mobile action row. |
| `SellPositionModal.tsx` | **Direct.** Standard viewport contract and narrow-grid review. |
| `QuickCashModal.tsx` | **Direct.** Standard viewport contract; 4 quick-adjust buttons must remain comfortably tappable. |
| `ConfirmDeleteModal.tsx` | **Inherited + direct contract.** Small content is already compact, but modal must inherit universal short-viewport safety and touch sizing. |
| `PriceAlertsModal.tsx` | **Mostly inherited.** Already max-height/scroll safe; audit header/filter rows and card action wrapping. |
| `GoogleSheetsModal.tsx` | **Direct.** Existing scroll model is good; reduce narrow-screen padding and validate footer/action/selector width. |
| `PythonSchemaSyncModal.tsx` | **Direct.** Viewport contract, code block horizontal scroll, action/footer reachability. |
| `PortfolioBackupModal.tsx` | **High-priority direct fix.** Long modal currently lacks outer scroll/max-height; internal option rows also need mobile stacking. |
| `TradeScreenshotModal.tsx` | **Direct.** Existing max-height model retained; header chips, 2/4-column edit grid, footer actions require narrow-screen layout. |
| `PWAInstallButton.tsx` | **Mostly inherited.** Modal already scroll-safe; install/header targets and text fit need audit. |

### Shared controls / rare states

| File | Phase 6 disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `AnalyticsSelect.tsx` | **Direct shared primitive.** Dropdown width/edge containment and touch row sizing; avoid viewport escape near screen edges. |
| `DateInput.tsx` | **Direct.** Calendar trigger is currently too small for touch; preserve native picker behavior. |
| `NumberStepperInput.tsx` | **High-priority direct.** Current 32px-wide two-button stepper produces tiny tap targets; create coarse-pointer behavior without bloating desktop. |
| `ErrorBoundary.tsx` | **Mostly inherited.** Verify action stacking and page gutters. |
| `SupabaseAuthGate.tsx` | **Mostly inherited.** Validate keyboard/narrow viewport and field/button touch sizing. |
| `StockLogo.tsx` | **Intentional exclusion.** Existing size API is responsive-safe; no Phase 6 surface layout ownership. |
| `PremiumMotion.tsx` | **Frozen.** No Phase 6 lifecycle/easing changes. Existing media-query hooks may be consumed but motion architecture stays Phase 4-owned. |

---

## 5. Planned implementation passes

### Pass 0 — Responsive primitives and safety baseline

**Status: COMPLETE.**

Goal:
- solve repeated responsive problems once before screen-level rollout.

Implemented:
- **db4bcc3** — add Phase 6 shared responsive safety primitives in `src/index.css`.
- Add canonical responsive tokens:
  - `--premium-touch-target: 2.75rem` (44px);
  - `--premium-mobile-gutter: 0.75rem`;
  - `--premium-modal-gutter: 0.75rem`;
  - fixed-overlay max width token.
- On phone widths or coarse pointers, shared actions/nav/filter pills/segments/choices/accordion/select triggers now receive a 44px minimum target and `touch-action: manipulation`.
- Shared icon actions receive a 44x44 minimum target.
- Direct shared input/select/textarea fields receive a 44px minimum height.
- Menu rows receive the same coarse-pointer minimum target.
- `NumberStepperInput` is intentionally excluded from generic `.premium-control` sizing because its split vertical control requires a dedicated Pass 5 solution.
- Add opt-in `.premium-modal-viewport` and `.premium-modal-scroll-body` helpers using `dvh`, overscroll containment, and stable scroll gutters.
- Add `.premium-fixed-overlay`, `.premium-mobile-min-w-0`, and `.premium-mobile-full` helpers for later component rollout.
- Mobile modal backdrops now use safe-area-aware padding.
- Mobile dropdowns receive viewport max-width/max-height containment and overscroll containment.

No component-specific layout was changed in Pass 0.

Quality Checks **#600** passed typecheck, tests, and production build. User validation accepted the shared mobile/coarse-pointer baseline. Pass 0 is complete.

Validation:
- desktop visual density materially unchanged;
- no new clipping or layout shift;
- Phase 4/5 motion/effects unchanged.

### Pass 1 — Persistent shell and main app chrome

**Status: IMPLEMENTED — CI clean; awaiting mobile visual validation before Pass 2.**

Scope:
- `App.tsx`;
- `Header.tsx`;
- `PortfolioSummary.tsx`;
- `OfflineIndicator.tsx`.

Implemented:
- **ae08150** — extend the responsive baseline with mobile fixed-overlay safe-area/stacking helpers and ensure icon-only shared actions have a 44px minimum width on touch.
- **24ac8d2 / bf3cdd1** — clamp App undo/notification toasts to mobile safe gutters, allow text wrapping, keep action buttons reachable, and stack Undo above persistent bottom status surfaces.
- **dbe2a30** — convert the phone Header utility cluster into one horizontally scrollable action rail instead of a tall wrapping control block; keep the existing navigation rail horizontally scrollable and leave navigation architecture unchanged.
- **3a625d8** — tighten phone Portfolio Summary padding/gaps, keep the 2-column KPI layout, hide low-priority KPI annotations below `sm`, allow long P&L/footer content to wrap, and align live-feed actions cleanly.
- **132295e** — clamp Offline/Firestore status surfaces to mobile safe gutters, allow status text to wrap, and keep the Sync action independently tappable.
- **3fd4190 / bc9e7f7** — prevent fixed-toast/header/status collisions and keep fixed-overlay width clamping mobile-only so desktop sizing remains unchanged.
- User screenshot validation found the initial mobile Header rail still visually noisy/off-center and highlighted redundant migration-era controls.
- **05f2316 / 2f1ed56 / 8019ca1** — remove the obsolete manual database Force Sync header action and the standalone Google/Firebase Sign In/avatar/Sign Out controls. Supabase already gates the app and owns portfolio persistence; optional Google authentication remains inside the Google Sheets modal. The remaining six Header actions are Alerts, Live Prices, Google Sheets, Backup/Reconcile, Scan, and Add Trade. Mobile count/status decorations are taken out of normal icon flow so the icons remain centered.
- **5c44fdb** — remove the dead Firestore-quota status branch. The migration shim already reports no quota state and no-op retry behavior; `OfflineIndicator` now represents only the real browser offline state.
- **1928172** — user-requested early Pass 2 correction: move mobile position sector metadata into the identity row and keep DCA, Sell, Edit, and Delete in one compact four-control row so Delete cannot create a standalone second row/card-height penalty.
- Accepted design direction: **Backup/Reconcile is maintenance/recovery, not a primary header action.** Preserve the capability, but plan to remove it from the permanent Header and relocate it into a Data Management/Settings surface when the navigation/settings architecture is handled. Do not delete backup/export/restore/reconciliation functionality.
- Cleanup debt: `PortfolioBackupModal` still contains legacy Firebase wording after restore; replace it with Supabase/cloud-neutral copy when that modal is touched in Pass 3.

Quality Checks **#620** passed typecheck, tests, and production build on the revised Header/Positions state. User validation accepted Pass 1 and requested moving to the next pass.

Validation target:
- 320 / 360 / 390 / 430 widths;
- portrait + short landscape;
- Header utility rail remains reachable without excessive vertical growth;
- persistent nav remains horizontally accessible;
- fixed toast/status layers do not collide;
- summary cards remain legible without page-level horizontal overflow.

### Pass 2 — Core data tabs

**Status: COMPLETE.**

Scope:
- Positions;
- Closed Cycles;
- Journal;
- Cash;
- Directory.

Implemented:
- **c387712 / fb6d709** — make the Positions page heading/action responsive and hide the redundant page-level “+ Add Position” button on phone because the integrated Add Trade action already remains reachable.
- **221b7d9 / 0f3639b** — remove Positions toolbar selector width pressure, preserve the desktop/mobile dual-render architecture, tighten phone card padding, harden identity/P&L shrink behavior, make the “Set Target & Stop-Loss” action responsive, and retain the user-approved one-row DCA/Sell/Edit/Delete layout.
- **3b769ab** — remove Closed Cycles search/sort fixed-width pressure and make sort/expand controls phone-safe.
- User validation rejected the initial Closed Cycles selector treatment because the responsive pass had drifted from the already-approved Transactions selector visual system.
- **f5b9c7d** — restore Closed Cycles to the canonical Transactions selector contract: `premium-selector-shell`, `premium-filter-pill`, semantic active classes, `aria-pressed`, matching 44px touch sizing, and the same selected-state glow/settle behavior. On phone it uses the same intentional horizontal selector rail rather than inventing a new 2×2 visual family.
- **94c533f / 795db90** — convert Journal outcome filters into an intentional horizontal phone rail, place sort/page-size selectors in a two-column mobile grid, clamp the deletion toast, and make both pagination rows fit phone widths with icon-first controls.
- **7243d37 / 830f2f3 / 4dd7f71** — reduce Cash Ledger phone panel padding, keep Deposit/Withdraw and history filters inside the canonical selector-shell visual language with flexible phone widths, defer history counts above `sm`, and give the cash table an explicit internal 720px scroll width so the page itself never needs to expand.
- **0b8af54** — make Directory header utilities a mobile 2-column action layout with Sync spanning the first row, remove sector-select minimum-width pressure, and slightly reduce phone card/header padding.

Design choices:
- **Responsive passes may change layout/fit only; they must not invent a new button/selector visual family.** Existing accepted primitives from Phases 2–5 remain canonical.
- Transactions is the canonical filter-selector reference for dense semantic filters: `premium-selector-shell` + `premium-filter-pill` + semantic active class + `aria-pressed`.
- horizontal scrolling remains intentional for dense selector rails and genuinely wide tables;
- desktop widths/minimums remain available from `sm`/`md` upward;
- no data, accounting, transaction, or chart logic changed;
- the early user-requested Positions action-row fix from Pass 1 is treated as part of the final Pass 2 state.

Checkpoint:
- no horizontal page overflow;
- every primary action reachable without precision tapping;
- cash table scrolls within its own shell;
- Journal filter/pagination controls remain reachable at 320px;
- desktop layout remains materially unchanged.

Quality Checks **#647** passed typecheck, tests, and production build on the corrected selector-style baseline. User validation moved the work to the next pass.

### Pass 3 — Modal and overlay family

**Status: CORRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE — historical self-healing repair added; awaiting CI and mobile/data re-validation.**

Goal:
- one consistent viewport behavior across all modal families without changing the accepted visual language.

Implemented:
- **ff28126** — add shared `premium-modal-frame` for structured flex modals while keeping `premium-modal-viewport` for simple scrolling panels; both use `dvh` and mobile safe-area-aware height limits.
- **6c02593** — make Portfolio Backup scroll safely within the usable viewport, reduce phone padding, stack maintenance/export/restore option rows on narrow screens, keep actions reachable, and correct the stale restore copy from Firebase to Supabase.
- **0c848aa / 62fd38e / d69d0a7** — make Edit Position, Quick Cash, and Confirm Delete viewport-safe; keep short modals centered while allowing internal scroll when keyboard/short-landscape height requires it; make destructive/confirm action rows phone-safe.
- **edce550 / 3e9081e** — make Add Trade and Sell Position long forms `dvh`-bounded, collapse cramped two-column input groups below `sm`, stack fee/header utility rows where needed, and keep Cancel/Confirm actions reachable.
- **6803097 / e5630f3** — apply the same contract to Journal Edit and Cash Edit; preserve their established selector/choice styling while making action rows and calculated previews fit narrow screens.
- **c0f6844** — convert Google Sheets to a structured fixed-header / scroll-body modal with `premium-modal-frame`; stack account/URL/rebuild controls safely on phone while preserving existing action styles.
- **18240f3** — make Schema Sync viewport-safe, horizontally scroll its sub-tab rail instead of widening the page, stack code/payload action rows on phone, and collapse schema reference fields to one column below `sm`.
- **b586167** — replace Price Alerts' hard `90vh` cap with the shared frame contract; make header/permission/footer rows wrap safely; keep its tab strip horizontally reachable; scroll only the modal body.
- **cd96b6a** — replace Screenshot Scanner's hard `90vh` cap with the shared frame contract; keep header/footer fixed, make review controls/cards stack on phone, reduce phone dropzone padding, and keep footer actions reachable.
- **7f18d1d** — make the PWA install guide use the shared frame contract with a scrollable body and fixed header/footer.
- User mobile validation found a nested-scroll failure in **Add Trade** and **Transaction Edit**: the top receipt/type controls could sit above the reachable viewport and iOS rubber-band scrolling snapped back before the user could reach them.
- **24986ff / 9ade473 / 682deea** — introduce a panel-owned mobile scroll contract for those long forms. On phone the backdrop is top-anchored to the safe area and prevented from becoming a competing vertical scroller; the `premium-modal-viewport` panel exclusively owns vertical touch scrolling, eliminating the spring-back path while preserving desktop centering.
- The same validation exposed ticker-master data debt outside the visual scope. **276cfb7 / 262ac1c / 0053738 / 5f07095 / 54f6a61 / de9557e** correct KORA, add NAPR, canonicalize TradingView ISIN-form symbols to known EGX tickers, merge saved/Supabase ticker directories with the current baseline, and rehydrate stale position/transaction identity metadata. This is an explicit data-correctness exception requested during Pass 3, not a visual redesign.
- **f01dd96** adds regression coverage for NAPR ISIN canonicalization, KORA identity/sector correction, baseline merge behavior, and live-price metadata repair.
- User clarified that fixing only NAPR/KORA was insufficient and requested a full ticker-directory side quest.
- **4c72efa / bb3c9a4 / b840b93 / 3651257** — convert the static dictionary into an offline/Arabic/legacy fallback instead of the authoritative live directory. Add current sector categories, central legacy aliases, retired-baseline filtering, current symbol/ISIN corrections, and market-sector/industry classification mapping.
- Verified baseline corrections include current QNBE, SAUD (Al Baraka Bank Egypt), OBRI (El Ebour Real Estate), ECAP (El Ezz Porcelain/Gemma), AIHC, ASPI, NARE, ORAS, CIEB, HDBK, KORA, NAPR, RAYA, and MTIE identities/classifications. Legacy aliases such as QNBA/QNBF, MNHD, AUTO, OTMT, UBEG, AIH and PIOH migrate to their current symbols rather than appearing as duplicate active rows.
- **1f5cc09 / 6755eb0** — expand the TradingView Egypt scanner payload to collect current `description`, `sector`, `industry`, `isin`, and `currency` for the entire discovered EGP equity universe (range 0–500). Live metadata now wins over static fallback metadata and is persisted through the existing market-price sync path. Non-EGP alternate share classes are excluded because the portfolio valuation UI is EGP-denominated.
- **e838494** — propagate refreshed ticker identity metadata into open positions, transactions, and closed-cycle views so historical UI does not keep stale company names/sectors after the directory is corrected.
- **0c30598 / e0ffa88** — make Add Trade and Stocks & Prices searchable by ISIN in addition to ticker and company name.
- **8f6df6b** — stop fabricating Arabic company names for live-only scanner discoveries; unknown Arabic metadata remains blank rather than storing false text.
- **8bc4bdf / 8e44acd** — extend regression coverage for renamed-symbol migration, retired baseline/cache cleanup, current known identities/ISINs, live-metadata precedence, classification, and live-only ticker behavior.
- **a359617** — purge non-migratable retired rows from old local/Supabase ticker caches while preserving historical ledger records separately; when a legacy alias and a current symbol collide, the canonical/current live record wins.

Side-quest acceptance:
- the static seed is no longer expected to enumerate the whole active EGX;
- every EGP security returned by the live Egypt scanner with a usable quote is discovered/updated automatically;
- current scanner name/ISIN/classification beats stale fallback data;
- saved/Supabase directories retain prices while gaining newly discovered current securities;
- historical aliases collapse to current symbols without duplicate active rows;
- ticker and ISIN are both valid directory/search identifiers.

Quality Checks **#692** passed typecheck, tests, and production build on the completed full-directory migration.

Historical analytics repair side quest:
- Production validation showed the 1W/1M chart excluding four valuation dates after a newly-added ACTF position. Direct Supabase inspection confirmed ACTF had **0 rows** in both `price_history` and `intraday_price_history`, while the other open positions had daily history through Sep 22.
- The analytics engine is intentionally strict: a historical valuation is excluded when any held ticker lacks a trustworthy close at or before that valuation date. The chart was therefore protecting NAV accuracy rather than fabricating ACTF history.
- User explicitly requested that ACTF remain empty so it can serve as the real end-to-end repair test fixture; no manual ACTF rows were inserted.
- **90ba3fa / dc40c9b** — add a pure historical-coverage planner plus regression tests for zero-history tickers, backdated requirements, internal market-day gaps, stale tails, weekend handling, and healthy no-op coverage.
- **03fcb0e** — rewrite `scripts/syncHistoricalPrices.ts` into a gap-aware self-healing job. It derives required history from both transactions and open positions, detects missing coverage, resolves TradingView by canonical ticker with ISIN fallback, requests only the repair range, and upserts repaired daily bars.
- **e4310db** — change Historical Prices automation from once-daily blind sync to repeated gap-aware repair after/around the EGX close and evening; healthy coverage exits before opening a TradingView session. Workflow dispatch also supports optional ticker/date targeting for manual validation.
- **9d4593b** — correct the weekend regression fixture so it isolates stale-tail behavior rather than accidentally testing a missing historical head.
- **1d2be35 / 5762cab** — page Supabase history coverage reads and make paging deterministic so repair planning remains correct as stored history grows beyond one API page.
- Acceptance rule: missing history is repaired by the automation itself; the app must never fill historical valuation holes with today's price or a fabricated zero.

Quality Checks **#702** passed typecheck, tests, and production build on the completed historical self-healing implementation. ACTF remains intentionally at **0** daily history rows pending the deliberate end-to-end workflow test.

Responsive rules preserved:
- no modal, button, choice, selector, semantic state, glow, refraction, or motion visual language was redesigned;
- accepted Phase 2–5 classes remain the source of truth;
- Pass 3 changes layout/reachability only;
- wide content scrolls inside its intended region, never by widening the page;
- desktop composition remains materially unchanged.

Checkpoint:
- all modal content/actions reachable on 320px portrait and short phone landscape;
- no footer hidden below viewport;
- no backdrop content clipping;
- dropdowns remain inside the mobile viewport;
- no selector/button style regression.

### Pass 4 — Reports and chart shells

**Status: IMPLEMENTED — Quality Checks passed; awaiting mobile visual validation.**

Scope:
- Performance Reports;
- main analytics shell;
- Risk & Cost shells;
- trajectory chart;
- Monthly/Trading reports;
- shared chart tooltip shell.

Implemented:
- shared analytics tooltips now clamp to the actual mobile viewport instead of carrying a conflicting fixed minimum width;
- the primary analytics chart uses a shorter phone canvas while retaining the accepted desktop height and all existing series/interpolation behavior;
- Today-resolution and timeframe selectors remain the accepted premium control family but now use bounded horizontal access on narrow screens instead of wrapping into unstable multi-row layouts;
- Risk & Cost chart headers stack their headline metrics safely on phones and use reduced phone-only chart heights;
- the realized P&L trajectory mode switcher becomes a two-column phone control while retaining the accepted desktop segmented layout;
- Portfolio Allocation controls become full-width/mobile-safe, the allocation canvas shortens on phones, and its custom tooltip no longer overrides the shared viewport clamp;
- Trading Performance and Monthly Audit control bars now fit narrow screens with full-width selects/search, reachable export/print actions, and horizontally accessible selectors;
- both dense report tables now preserve a deliberate minimum table width inside touch-scroll containers so columns remain readable instead of collapsing into unusable narrow cells;
- report footers and dense report shells stack/wrap safely without changing their accepted visual hierarchy.

Real-device validation findings and corrections:
- landscape/tablet navigation was keeping desktop-length labels too early, causing the rightmost tabs to clip; sub-2XL navigation now uses compact labels, retains horizontal fallback, and automatically keeps the active tab in view;
- the institutional KPI ribbon entered four-column mode before each card had enough intrinsic width; four columns now require a 2XL viewport, with one/two-column layouts below that breakpoint;
- the benchmark detail section is no longer forced into a dense table on phone/tablet: the same indicator calculations now render as one-column phone / two-column tablet **hero-tier** scorecards using the accepted hero-card frosted glass, refraction depth, semantic edge/halo glow, measured-result hierarchy, institutional target, and assessment chip; the institutional table remains the 2XL desktop renderer;
- the Monthly Audit now also uses a dual renderer, but with a different information architecture from the benchmark scorecards: each normalized audit row becomes exactly one phone/tablet trade/holding card, preserving the row's instrument/status/shares/entry/exit-or-market/performance/fees/notes relationship; phone uses one card per row, tablet uses two columns, and the full institutional table remains the 2XL desktop renderer;
- Monthly Audit cards consume the same normalized `auditRecords` array as the desktop table, so responsive presentation cannot diverge from the audit data model; liquidated wins/losses receive semantic green/red hero glow, current holdings use blue, and held-at-month-end/later-closed records use purple;
- the month-level Monthly Audit container is deliberately neutral frosted glass with no profit/loss halo or colored semantic border; monthly profitability remains visible in the month badge and Realized P&L summary, while semantic glow belongs to the individual audit cards so mixed winning/losing records do not visually conflict with the outer shell;
- the Monthly Audit outer month shell is a **structural, non-interactive glass container**, not a card: it no longer inherits `premium-report-glass` hover/elevation behavior, never scales/lifts on touch or hover, and explicitly gives vertical pan to the page so scrolling over nested audit cards has one tactile interaction layer instead of two;
- a post-layout correctness audit found that the month banner/KPIs still summarized the old closed-only monthly aggregates even while `All Records` displayed closed trades plus holdings. The summary now derives from the same filtered `auditRecords` array as the visible cards/table: All = closed + holdings, Liquidated = closed only, Holdings = holdings only, and search filtering is reflected too. Open-position unrealized P&L now uses the canonical fee-inclusive accounting helper; closed win rate uses decisive wins/losses only and excludes breakevens.
- the generic responsive report hero-card surface is shared by benchmark and Monthly Audit cards, preserving the accepted hero-card frosted glass, refraction depth, semantic edge/halo glow, and hover behavior without copying component-local glass recipes.

Validation:
- final real-device correction Quality Checks passed typecheck, 27/27 test files, 170/170 tests, the production Vite build, and the bundled server build on implementation snapshot `db66d310c132dff8b262df77d420ae735cae077c`;
- the responsive benchmark scorecard renderer passed a second full Quality gate on implementation snapshot `7644ee7790d8747bd5dc1461484a003e530f3be4`: 27/27 test files, 170/170 tests, typecheck, production Vite build, and bundled server build;
- real-device feedback showed the first card renderer still used the low-intensity `premium-report-glass-soft` surface and therefore did not visually match the accepted hero cards; that surface was removed and replaced with `premium-hero-metric` + dedicated hero-tier semantic glass/halo classes on snapshot `742e97f72d05552e52bd18a006f453128642b515`; the correction passed 27/27 test files, 170/170 tests, typecheck, production Vite build, and bundled server build;
- Monthly Audit's normalized one-record-per-row card renderer passed the full Quality gate on implementation snapshot `2f4a920bd055d6c13e06e0da352f39a4bf4e4147`: 27/27 test files, 170/170 tests, typecheck, production Vite build, and bundled server build;
- the structural month-shell scroll fix passed the full Quality gate on implementation snapshot `35fdf7fad574b02f02f21fc02f9216b696281a96`: 27/27 test files, 170/170 tests, typecheck, production Vite build, and bundled server build;
- the filter-aware Monthly Audit summary/accounting correction passed the full Quality gate on implementation snapshot `d5caf609cf74e5f7c8aef9e6327e720ded14f88c`: 28/28 test files, 173/173 tests, typecheck, production Vite build, and bundled server build;
- the earlier intraday smoke also passed after the main analytics shell changes.

Hard boundary preserved:
- no chart series, financial observations, interpolation, axis semantics, or Phase 7 visual redesign changed;
- no persistence or market-data behavior changed; the later Monthly Audit correction intentionally aligned report summary accounting with the canonical visible-record calculations instead of preserving the stale closed-only aggregate;
- existing Phase 2–5 control/surface styling remains the source of truth.

### Pass 5 — Shared controls and rare states

**Status: IMPLEMENTED — awaiting inclusion in the final Pass 6 device/CI validation gate.**

Scope:
- AnalyticsSelect;
- DateInput;
- NumberStepperInput;
- auth/error/PWA/status edge cases.

Implemented:
- **f324da6 / 8eb025d** — make `AnalyticsSelect` choose its opening edge from actual trigger geometry and calculate a per-open viewport width cap, including resize/orientation updates while open. The shared dropdown remains an overlay and retains the accepted premium selector styling.
- **c3baaf9** — enlarge the native `DateInput` calendar hit area to a true 44px target while preserving the existing visual icon treatment and native browser picker.
- **073336b / 7a66b** — replace the unusably small stacked +/- stepper buttons on coarse pointers with full-height 44px left/right decrement/increment controls; desktop retains the compact vertical stepper rail.
- **87c15d4 / 8f60c35** — add the shared Pass 5 CSS contracts for coarse-pointer steppers and geometry-clamped select menus without changing desktop control density.
- **1ee4146** — make the Supabase auth gate `dvh`/keyboard safe, keep the form scroll-reachable on short viewports, and use 16px phone input text to avoid mobile browser focus zoom.
- **2ed96ca** — make the Error Boundary recovery state `dvh`/scroll safe and allow long runtime errors to wrap inside the diagnostic surface.
- **eb11566** — harden the PWA install guide for narrow widths: shrink-safe header/instruction content, reachable close/confirm actions, and no horizontal body overflow.
- Offline/fixed status behavior remains owned by the already-completed Pass 1 contract; Pass 5 introduces no competing status presentation.

Validation notes:
- component-level source review confirms the shared controls preserve existing value/change behavior; this pass changes hit geometry, viewport containment, and responsive layout only;
- PR **#27** remains open against `main`; final repository typecheck/tests/build are reserved for the consolidated Pass 6 validation gate together with the full device matrix.

### Pass 6 — Full 34-file responsive validation

**Status: COMPLETE — code audit, CI, and final real-device smoke accepted.**

Completed:
- audited `src/App.tsx` plus all **33 non-test TSX component files** for remaining fixed-width, viewport-height, modal, overlay, touch-target, and tooltip risks;
- confirmed surviving fixed minimum widths are either gated to `sm/md+` or belong to deliberate horizontally scrollable dense tables;
- confirmed compact modal close controls inherit the shared 44px coarse-pointer contract rather than remaining precision targets;
- confirmed report/table minimum widths remain inside dedicated overflow shells;
- confirmed the 260px primary chart tooltip minimum still fits the supported 320px floor under the shared viewport cap;
- **d87ecfc** — replace the final app-root `min-h-screen` viewport primitive with `min-h-[100dvh]` so the main shell follows the same dynamic mobile viewport contract as auth/error/modal states.

CI validation:
- temporary validation branch: `ci/phase6-pass6-responsive-audit-gate`;
- Quality Checks **#745** passed;
- typecheck passed;
- **28/28 test files, 173/173 tests** passed;
- production Vite build passed in **6.23s**.

Real-device closure matrix still required:
- 320 / 360 / 390 / 430px portrait;
- 768px boundary;
- short phone landscape;
- no page-level horizontal overflow;
- no clipped modal/dropdown/fixed overlay;
- touch targets usable;
- primary actions reachable;
- tables intentionally scroll rather than clip;
- chart tooltips stay inside usable viewport;
- desktop remains unchanged unless explicitly intended;
- reduced-motion remains functional.

Final real-device smoke was accepted on 2026-09-25. Phase 6 is complete; navigation architecture is now owned by Phase 6.5.

## 7. Change-control rule

During Phase 6, this file is the detailed active execution plan.

Update it in the same work pass whenever:
- a responsive primitive changes;
- a component requires a different disposition;
- a mobile workaround is accepted/rejected;
- a later-phase boundary changes;
- a pass completes or a validation gate changes.

After Phase 6 completes, mark this file historical. The active cross-phase roadmap remains `PREMIUM_UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md`.
