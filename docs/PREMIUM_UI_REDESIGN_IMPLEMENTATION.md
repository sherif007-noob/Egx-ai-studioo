# Premium UI Redesign Implementation Log

## Purpose

This document records what has actually been implemented for the EGX Portfolio premium UI redesign on **feature/premium-ui-redesign**.

- **Plan:** intended scope, boundaries, phases, and acceptance criteria.
- **Implementation log:** actual changes, validation findings, representative commits, provisional work, and exceptions/restorations.

Repository: **sherif007-noob/EGX-Portfolio**  
Branch: **feature/premium-ui-redesign**  
Baseline: **ce142a0**  
Pull request: **#27 — Premium UI redesign foundation**

## Strict visual-only rule

This branch must not intentionally modify portfolio accounting, analytics calculations, transaction semantics, persistence, schemas, market-data rules, or business logic.

A redesign-caused regression may be restored so an existing interaction remains usable, but unrelated functional work belongs outside this visual-redesign branch.

## Status

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 9.6 mobile command architecture

Implementation range `eaa2a336dd8ba21832dc23d3d2a30ec4e35cc5da` → `fcc5d3f98d594138b2a9e8c115e5bc0b63251c88`.

Implemented:
- formalized mobile command ownership with accessible Quick utilities, Data and settings, and Create trade groups;
- portrait phone uses a deliberate two-tier header and three-zone command grid;
- quick utilities are the only horizontally scrollable command area;
- Data & Tools, Settings, Scan Receipt, and Add Trade remain fixed-access;
- quick utility scrolling gets snap behavior and a bounded fade affordance;
- preserved 44px touch targets for all mobile command actions;
- compact navigation now centers active/focused tabs when switching or using keyboard navigation;
- tightened mobile nav spacing and edge fades without changing navigation material or destinations;
- added a <=359px density guard that reduces wrapper spacing/padding only, never touch targets;
- short-landscape mode now keeps creation/data fixed and prevents the old whole-header action rail from scrolling;
- added `Phase96MobileCommandArchitecture.test.ts` to protect command ownership, compact-nav centering, touch targets, safe areas, and Phase 8 isolation.

Quality Checks #36298460804 passed install, typecheck, tests, and production build.

Next: **Pass 9.7 — desktop / 2XL refinement**.

## 2026-09-27 — Dropdown viewport-containment hardening

Implementation range `c80bf53d129bbb1b7f4e514c25938c8f75e51a59` → `32b43060546fe0eb4a1417d75756fbe1b9b4ea71`.

Device screenshots exposed a second defect in the dropdown standard: portaling the menus was not enough. Legacy `premium-select-dropdown` width rules could still override the computed inline geometry, and the shared positioning code only estimated vertical containment.

Fix:
- centralized dropdown placement in `src/utils/dropdownGeometry.ts`;
- compact shared selectors now target 320px but are hard-clamped to the visible viewport gutter;
- right-edge menus shift left and left-edge menus clamp rightward;
- bottom-edge menus open upward and receive a max-height equal to the actually available side;
- body-level dropdowns scroll internally instead of exceeding the visible viewport;
- portaled dropdown CSS explicitly disables legacy min/max-width rules that could expand the menu after geometry was calculated;
- AnalyticsSelect keeps the wider readable dropdown style while remaining fully viewport-contained;
- added numerical regression tests for phone, desktop, right edge, left edge, bottom edge, and oversized preferred widths.

Quality Checks #36284230784 passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

## 2026-09-27 — Dropdown visual-standard correction: shared overlay context

Implementation range `b3075429fe6f76b354171b0865f5c26fbc9ef530` → `8e2234590b3200f59398dd355f7da2fe4edaa7bb`.

Corrected the first dropdown-standard pass after device screenshots showed that only Data & Tools actually matched the intended material.

Root cause:
- the shared `premium-dropdown` CSS was applied correctly;
- however Data & Tools renders through `document.body`, while AnalyticsSelect, ticker autocomplete, and analytics-mode menus were still rendered inside transformed / backdrop-filtered cards and panels;
- nested backdrop contexts changed the apparent translucency/refraction, so the same CSS did **not** produce the same visual result.

Fix:
- extended `DropdownPresence` with canonical body-portal positioning anchored to the trigger;
- added viewport-clamped fixed geometry plus resize / scroll / `visualViewport` tracking;
- migrated every AnalyticsSelect dropdown to the body overlay context, covering sector, sort, status, page-size, trade-type, funding-method and other shared selectors;
- migrated Add Trade ticker autocomplete;
- migrated the main analytics mode menu;
- retained Data & Tools on its existing body portal;
- protected portaled dropdown interaction from outside-click handlers;
- strengthened `DropdownVisualStandard.test.ts` so current dropdown owners must share both `premium-dropdown` material **and** the canonical overlay context.

Quality Checks #36283628581 passed typecheck, tests and production build.

## 2026-09-27 — Side quest: canonical dropdown surface

Implementation range `b08ed62d3df79856459ccfb29ae7adbc24598c89` → `23956f2b362b5300b9806c83d80cbbcbe5b37eaa`.

Standardized the Phase 9 Data & Tools dropdown visual across the app:
- tuned the Data & Tools reference surface approximately **12% more transparent**;
- desktop base tint changed from 0.68 → 0.60;
- mobile base tint changed from 0.64 → 0.56;
- proportionally reduced the white/cyan/purple overlay alphas so the same glass composition is preserved instead of merely reducing one layer;
- retained the accepted blur, saturation, refraction, border luminosity and overlay elevation;
- `premium-dropdown` is now the canonical dropdown material primitive for all current custom menus/listboxes;
- AnalyticsSelect consumers (sector/status/sort/etc.), ticker autocomplete, analytics mode menu and Data & Tools all resolve through the same material recipe;
- added `DropdownVisualStandard.test.ts` to reject the legacy opaque slate dropdown recipe and require current menu/listbox owners to opt into `premium-dropdown`.

Quality Checks #36283020426 passed typecheck, tests and production build.

## 2026-09-27 — Data & Tools viewport-safety correction

Implementation range `27d1b6aa5d62976a79820f6236b769cdd8b860ee` → `8e3b6fa32892d38503743c487d201f779068b65a`.

Fixed a Phase 9.4 regression where the Data & Tools dropdown could open partly outside the visible screen on narrow devices.

Changes:
- replaced trigger-relative absolute placement with viewport-clamped fixed geometry;
- derives the allowed horizontal bounds from the resolved `.premium-safe-inline-header` padding, so iPhone safe areas and app gutters are respected;
- clamps menu width to the available safe viewport width;
- repositions on window resize plus `visualViewport` resize/scroll;
- renders the dropdown through `createPortal(..., document.body)` so sticky-header backdrop-filter / overflow contexts cannot clip or redefine its fixed positioning;
- added a separate menu ref so outside-click dismissal still works with the portaled menu;
- added `Phase94DataToolsViewport.test.ts` and updated the Phase 9.4 regression test.

Quality Checks #36282456713 passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 9.5 status communication

Implementation range `ea4238cbf965ad7c10896097900a3e56f57e84c7` → `21d84aefba82ab4da84aca7688bb29cce599b91f`.

Implemented:
- Price Alerts now communicates state with a compact unread-count badge, active dot, or paused dot;
- whole-button attention is applied to Alerts only when unread items exist;
- removed the permanent bounce animation from unread alerts so urgency comes from count/status rather than theatrical motion;
- Sync Prices now has explicit idle/running state, running label, spinner and cyan status dot;
- Data & Tools remains purple normally, shows connected state locally, and temporarily becomes amber/attention only when Sheets authentication has expired;
- standardized header status primitives for connected, warning, running, muted and count-badge states;
- added accessible status labels/data-state markers so state does not rely solely on color;
- added reduced-motion protection for active sync rotation;
- updated Phase 9.4 regression expectations and added `Phase95StatusCommunication.test.ts`.

Quality Checks #36282139801 passed install, typecheck, tests, and production build.

Next: **Pass 9.6 — mobile command architecture**.

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 9.4 utility/data-management consolidation

Implementation range `7525ed80bf75f01e510a262f9092bc5dfc328f48` → `f2e7a82c36e5848ee91344af355f81b84f7ee134`.

Implemented:
- retained Price Alerts and Sync Prices as direct utilities;
- consolidated Google Sheets and Backup & Reconcile under a single premium `Data & Tools` command;
- preserved Google Sheets connected/expired visibility on the consolidated trigger;
- added premium data-tool menu rows with structural emerald/amber/purple accents, refraction, luminous borders and restrained local bloom;
- retained the existing Google Sheets and Backup/Reconcile callbacks unchanged;
- added outside-click and Escape dismissal, plus close-on-selection behavior;
- kept Settings as a directly visible neutral premium utility for future plans;
- moved the data-management cluster outside the horizontally scrolling frequent-utility rail so its dropdown is not clipped by overflow;
- updated header-button regression coverage to recognize direct premium utility buttons and premium menu-item buttons as the same visual-language family;
- added `Phase94UtilityConsolidation.test.ts` to protect utility ownership, callback preservation, Sheets status, Settings visibility and Phase 8 material isolation.

Quality Checks #36281063871 passed install, typecheck, tests, and production build.

Next: **Pass 9.5 — status communication**.

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 9.3 primary creation architecture

Implementation range `141eb69fc8b9795220e741e60bddb0a4bee4844a` → `e949af579b42de43d84c1b214f515a22eb2333b9`.

Implemented:
- formalized Add Trade as `creation-primary` and Scan Receipt as `creation-secondary`;
- placed both inside a single dedicated premium creation cluster so the two controls read as related ways to record activity;
- gave the cluster restrained translucent glass, refraction and ambient cyan/purple atmosphere without competing with the buttons;
- strengthened Add Trade's blue border luminosity, near/far aura and hover/focus bloom while preserving its existing aurora/shimmer border;
- kept Scan Receipt emerald, premium and clearly secondary rather than flattening it;
- added explicit accessible labels for both creation actions;
- retained narrow-phone touch-target behavior and fixed-access creation;
- preserved both existing callbacks/workflows unchanged;
- added `Phase93CreationArchitecture.test.ts` to lock primary/secondary ownership and protect Phase 8 material contracts.

Quality Checks #36277267864 passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

Next: **Pass 9.4 — utility/data-management consolidation**.

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 9 visual-language correction

Implementation range `6e905f712b7b71a0d228da86ee8571aaf88dc2f6` → `3421eb5598bfe9b857690426fe1e0d7445ae5a56`.

Correction after visual-direction review:
- reversed the over-de-emphasis introduced in 9.2: the active navigation tab is now intentionally more prominent than idle navigation;
- restored premium glass/refraction to idle navigation instead of leaving it visually flat;
- strengthened active-tab border luminosity, glass depth, icon bloom, underline and local aura while keeping the effect scoped to navigation;
- introduced a shared `premium-header-action` material family for Price Alerts, Sync Prices, Google Sheets, Backup & Reconcile, and Settings;
- each utility keeps a functional accent while sharing the same translucent glass / refraction / luminous-border / restrained-bloom recipe;
- preserved stronger creation tiers for Scan Receipt and Add Trade;
- Settings uses the same premium neutral utility language even though its actual settings UI remains intentionally deferred;
- added `Phase9HeaderButtonLanguage.test.ts` to prevent future flattening of utilities or weakening active navigation below idle state.

Quality Checks #36273839931 passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

Next: **Pass 9.3 — primary creation architecture**.

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 9.2 navigation refinement

Implementation range `3db77e40a06a9cbf38629183fd36571e13b12b74` → `e6f4ea727684310a3149afd0bba9f84468e02952`.

Changed:
- navigation now has explicit active and idle roles instead of relying on ad-hoc text/background utilities;
- inactive tabs are quieter while remaining readable and directly accessible;
- active tabs use localized border/accent/underline illumination instead of a broad competing glow;
- active navigation groups receive subtle label emphasis;
- separators are lighter and less visually dominant;
- compact/full labels now have dedicated hooks for later responsive refinement;
- keyboard focus-visible treatment is explicit and accent-aware;
- phone nav spacing is tighter without changing the horizontal-scroll model.

Protected:
- all seven navigation destinations;
- Portfolio / Activity / Insights grouping;
- ArrowLeft / ArrowRight / Home / End behavior;
- active-item scroll-into-view and edge affordances;
- Phase 8 content hierarchy, glass, aura, semantic edge and chart behavior.

The Phase 9 plan also now assigns final Settings-button visual-language treatment to **9.4 Utility/data-management consolidation**: neutral premium glass/refraction, restrained hover/focus bloom, and no primary or financial-semantic styling.

Quality Checks #36273301109 passed install, typecheck, tests, and production build.

Next: **Pass 9.3 — primary creation architecture.**

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 9.0–9.1 command-zone header foundation

Implementation range `11d4473e8a0cc4bd34ac8b98db6d5ba9f0d3bfd1` → `ec4fd20c30c4e049101536401821312566aade27`.

Implemented:
- created the Phase 9 header/navigation plan and froze Phase 8 content/material ownership;
- separated header utilities from global creation actions;
- grouped Price Alerts, Sync Prices, Google Sheets, Backup & Reconcile, and the new Settings affordance into a quiet utility cluster;
- kept Scan Receipt and Add Trade in a separate creation cluster;
- kept Add Trade as the only primary CTA in the new architecture;
- ensured mobile utility overflow can scroll without pushing the creation cluster off-screen;
- added a visible Settings button as a future entry point only — no Settings modal, settings model, persistence, or configuration behavior exists yet;
- clicking Settings currently produces only a lightweight informational toast;
- preserved all seven nav destinations, group structure, keyboard behavior, active-tab scrolling, safe areas, reduced motion, alert status, sync state, and Sheets state;
- added `Phase90HeaderArchitecture.test.ts` to protect the Phase 9 functional contract and prevent Settings/utility actions from becoming primary.

Quality Checks #36272919126 passed install, typecheck, tests, and production build.

Next: **Pass 9.2 — navigation refinement.**

### 2026-09-26 — Pass 8.3b aura / glow intensification

Commit `2eebfa0d5ff9647292acaa1ada26e439801283a4` increases **only** the resting/hover aura and glow strength after device feedback that the restored material language was still too restrained.

Changed:
- stronger neutral hierarchy-card ambient bloom;
- stronger internal material sheen;
- semantic WIN / LOSS / BUY / BREAKEVEN cards now use a wider and brighter near + far aura at rest;
- the Overview semantic hero receives the strongest aura tier;
- cyan / blue / emerald / rose / amber structural-tone cards receive stronger ambient bloom;
- panel and EGX Live Market Feed structural glow is increased;
- hover glow scales upward from the stronger resting state rather than being the only time the aura becomes obvious.

Protected / unchanged:
- Phase 8 hierarchy and layout;
- glass opacity / blur recipe;
- semantic meaning and color mapping;
- semantic edge geometry, including the accepted corner-wrap/fade;
- spacing, typography, component structure and behavior.

Quality Checks run `36253526700` passed typecheck, tests and production build. Device visual acceptance remains pending before closing 8.3.

### 2026-09-26 — Semantic edge corner-wrap refinement

Commit `e48d694b2dc7a93ca0e89f910be4a72c84067916` refines the accepted additive semantic edge. The edge now follows the card's actual rounded left border, wraps through both upper-left and lower-left corner curves, then fades progressively along the top and bottom borders. The host card's glass, semantic border, near aura, far bloom, refraction and box-shadow remain untouched.

## 2026-09-26 — Additive semantic edge restored

Commit `fd23594ce216167d8710859241f91688999e5d50` restores the liked semantic edge accent to transaction cards, open-position cards, closed-cycle cards, and Monthly Performance audit cards.

The edge is intentionally **additive**:

- it is rendered through a dedicated `.premium-semantic-edge::after` layer;
- it does not alter the card background, glass blur, border, or host box-shadow;
- full semantic near/far aura remains active;
- the edge color follows the existing semantic state for transactions/positions/cycles;
- Monthly Performance cards map the edge to their existing report tone;
- the edge is a narrow luminous left rail with local bloom, visually integrated with the card's full-card semantic aura.

Quality Checks run `36224476265` passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

## 2026-09-26 — Phase 8 material restoration: Monthly Report reference locked

The accepted Phase 8 hierarchy remains active, but glass/aura/glow are now restored independently from hierarchy.

- Production restoration: `d801db35e46ceb826361bfe43132f25c1269d9c4`
- Hover parity correction: `477f95930d0657e1f9dbcc85e0fc45749b6ed84d`
- Quality gate: **Quality Checks #36223796577 — PASS** (typecheck, tests, build)
- Canonical visual reference: the accepted **Monthly Performance audit cards** (`.premium-report-hero-card` family).
- Hierarchy cards now use translucent 24px-blur glass with internal sheen/refraction rather than opaque hierarchy slabs.
- Semantic win/loss/breakeven/buy cards retain full-card near + far aura at Monthly-Report-grade strength; hierarchy rank does not attenuate the semantic material.
- Dense mobile record cards keep full semantic halos; Phase 8 does not replace them with edge-only coding.
- Overview hero regains its pre-Phase-8 hero material role. Market Value / Cash / Brokerage Fees receive explicit structural cyan / blue / amber material tones, and EGX Live Market Feed is restored as a real glass utility surface.
- Cash KPI cards receive explicit emerald / blue / rose material tones without changing their hierarchy level or business semantics.

This establishes a hard rule: **H0–H5 controls hierarchy; accepted pre-Phase-8 primitives control material.**

## 2026-09-26 — Combined Pass 8.6–8.7 responsive validation and regression gate

Implementation range `fba08d53e7fbbd5efa20d808fe4101b2a51c8f37` → `48eb5dd49d858c09ed640015b046529da8d66516`.

Responsive fixes:
- added a <=390px hierarchy-only scale/padding guard so large financial values remain dominant without causing narrow-phone overflow;
- kept the content area capped at `max-w-7xl` on desktop while reducing phone inline padding and moving the shell onto canonical major-flow spacing;
- fixed collision-prone mobile headers in Open Positions, Transactions, Monthly Performance audit cards, and Ticker Directory records by stacking only below the existing responsive breakpoint;
- allowed Cash audit heading/status content to wrap safely;
- kept report tables horizontally scrollable and dense selectors responsive rather than forcing desktop widths.

Regression/closure work:
- added `Phase867ResponsiveClosure.test.ts`;
- verifies Overview H1→H4 structure, report/dense responsive behavior, desktop containment, narrow-phone scale, and Header deferral to Phase 9;
- explicitly proves responsive CSS does not alter glass, aura, glow, border material, or semantic-edge geometry.

Quality Checks #36270371223 passed install, typecheck, tests, and production build.

**Phase 8 is not marked closed yet.** Two prerequisites remain: Pass 8.5 action-priority/control de-emphasis has not been executed, and device visual acceptance is still required for the final 8.4/8.6 responsive result.

## 2026-09-26 — Pass 8.4.5 full consistency sweep

Implementation range `a3964c8ea2d0878a6cfe7d8444b3ee4cff21a8d9` → `57a46324b1834a737bb558b3d179b33ca7fa3abe` completes the code portion of Phase 8.4.

The sweep:
- removes remaining arbitrary helper/metadata type sizes in Phase-8-owned screens;
- preserves intentional compact status/control chips;
- removes the final arbitrary tracked allocation caption;
- normalizes remaining report/dense spacing drift;
- adds `Phase845ConsistencySweep.test.ts` to reject known hierarchy regressions;
- leaves glass, aura, glow, semantic edges, semantic colors, charts, controls, motion and financial behavior unchanged.

Quality Checks #36265246582 passed install, typecheck, tests and production build.

Phase 8.4 now requires device visual validation only before closure.

## 2026-09-26 — Pass 8.4.4 global spacing rhythm normalization

Implementation range `6e9f75bff50003aaefbea67e498bc96d177b67e9` → `59a1b4c8ca41774a9982606cbab20eaa2455ecc8` replaces ad-hoc top-level spacing and card padding with canonical hierarchy-owned rhythm helpers.

Key results:
- major sections, related groups and control/dense-record groups now use distinct shared spacing tiers;
- H1–H5 surfaces use shared hierarchy padding helpers instead of locally drifting `p-*` values in the migrated screens;
- dense workflows remain compact, with tighter mobile control gaps;
- desktop spacing now emphasizes conceptual grouping rather than equal-weight separation;
- no glass, aura, glow, semantic edge, semantic color, typography scale, chart, motion or business behavior was changed.

Quality Checks #36263281878 passed typecheck, tests and production build.

## 2026-09-26 — Pass 8.4.3 dense workflow typography migration

Commit `7b018b96c8a5470f82a4bdccd11d8f603a75ca39` applies the canonical typography system to Open Positions, Closed Cycles, Transactions, Cash Ledger, and Ticker Directory.

Key results:
- H5 operational records use the dense metric scale rather than dashboard KPI sizing;
- H3 summary metrics use canonical metric labels and hierarchy-appropriate values;
- EGP units are subordinate;
- company / sector / date / supporting context use metadata/helper roles;
- dense workflows remain compact;
- glass, aura, glow, semantic edge, semantic colors, motion, selectors, and business logic were not changed.

Quality Checks #36258191821 passed typecheck, tests and production build.

## 2026-09-26 — Pass 8.4.2 Overview + Reports typography migration

Commit `d079304e798b022e2ef1e1d488eb9dc8253b9ace` applies the 8.4 typography system to Overview and Reports.

Key changes:
- hero / primary / secondary / dense financial metric scales are now used in hierarchy-sensitive surfaces;
- EGP and similar units use the subordinate unit helper;
- non-status metadata no longer relies on unnecessary uppercase/tracking;
- Monthly Performance keeps its accepted glass, aura and semantic edge while its typography is normalized;
- Trading Performance KPI and benchmark typography now follows the same system;
- no material, semantic, chart, motion or business-logic behavior changed.

Quality Checks #36257664993 passed typecheck, tests and production build.

## 2026-09-26 — Pass 8.4.1 typography foundation

Pass 8.4 has started with a deliberately non-invasive foundation pass.

- exactly six hierarchy text roles remain canonical;
- metric values now have typed hero / primary / secondary / dense scale helpers;
- `premium-type-unit` provides a subordinate EGP/%/shares/days treatment without adding another hierarchy role;
- no production screen has been mass-migrated yet;
- no glass, aura, glow, semantic edge, color mapping, chart, motion or business behavior was changed;
- `docs/PHASE8_4_TYPOGRAPHY_AUDIT.md` records the screen-by-screen typography debt and migration order;
- Quality Checks #36257086507 passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

## 2026-09-26 — Phase 8 hierarchy/material split

The earlier full Phase 8 rollback was too broad. Commit `7e17bd33c3d61c59dd88dc88365c37bdab6f57ba` restores the accepted Phase 8 hierarchy, layout, typography, report composition, Overview hierarchy, and dense-workflow structure while keeping pre-Phase-8 glass, aura, glow, and semantic-state styling as the material source of truth. Hierarchy CSS is now material-neutral: it must not set semantic glow alpha/radii, replace full-card halos with edge coding, or redefine glass/background recipes.

### Behavior-preservation note

During visual validation, Journal **Show → All** was corrected because the visible “All” option was internally capped at 1000 rows. This was treated as restoration of the interaction exposed by the existing UI, not as a new product feature. Further unrelated behavior changes must not be added to this branch.

## Phase 3.3 — Semantic polish and final consistency

Representative commits:

- **c13e1b9** — semantic report glow primitives
- **3d89d1b** — semantic report summary KPI glows
- **34d201a** — institutional-performance KPI semantics
- **835af8d** — Monthly Performance semantic glow

Established rules:
- Neutral buttons remain neutral on hover.
- Semantic buttons glow only in their own color family.
- Icon color cannot force an unrelated button glow.
- Selected selector glow derives from the selected semantic color.
- Non-selected dropdown hover uses a frosted accent wash; selected rows remain distinct.
- Date/time controls belong to the same visual family.

## Phase 4 — Motion: accepted five-family implementation

Phase 4 was originally started before Phase 3 completeness was fully validated, then paused. The provisional motion was noticeable, but user validation identified four problems:

1. Motion was generally **too fast**.
2. Motion coverage was incomplete/inconsistent across the application.
3. The analytics transition to/from **Today** no longer matched the smooth transition between other timeframes after the provisional chart-stage remount was introduced.
4. Secondary analytics charts explicitly disabled animation for intraday/Today, so their Today curve behavior differed from daily timeframes.

The accepted implementation now uses five motion families:

1. **Navigation / page context**
2. **Interactive controls**
3. **Overlays**
4. **Content / state changes**
5. **Charts / financial data visualization**

Existing provisional Phase 4 commits remain useful historical context, including:

- **9443028** — initial Phase 4 motion system
- **f2f3781** — analytics tooltip entrance
- **e79c52b** — dropdown micro-interactions
- **a748dbb** — analytics controls/timeframes
- **7d1223a** — menu/select motion
- **9735c6c** — Closed Cycle accordion
- **aba7bcc** — cash action switching
- **15dc243** — allocation segmented controls
- **8fa209a** — realized-chart mode switcher
- modal-motion commits for delete, screenshot, alerts, Schema Sync, Sheets, and Backup
- **b8bb158** — main-tab transitions
- **b146767** — stronger provisional motion
- **d9eea80**, **68951ad**, **9d4c181**, **3c107b0** — report/month/chart motion work
- **cdfa147** — later Phase 3/3.2 overrides that also altered motion timing

### Current accepted Phase 4 implementation

Representative commits:

- **87a9053** — establish five-family Phase 4 motion system
- **358e3f9** — restore unified analytics timeframe interpolation
- **b4dcf91** — unify Today secondary-chart transitions
- **1abaf0e** — animate allocation state transitions
- **a4db661** — animate Trading Performance filter-result changes
- **375dde6** — animate Monthly report state changes
- **f2ae057** — scope Edit Transaction BUY/SELL state motion correctly
- **06ded20** — normalize surface response timing
- **44d2820** — align Journal feedback with content-family motion
- **c53fb17** — align Cash feedback with content-family motion
- **9417325** — animate Add Trade contextual state

Canonical timing after user validation and full motion audit:
- Controls: ~320 ms
- Selectors: ~420 ms
- Dropdowns/overlays: ~480 ms
- Modals: ~560 ms
- Content/state/result changes: ~520 ms
- Main navigation/context: ~560 ms
- Charts: ~520 ms
- Tooltips: ~220 ms

### Analytics transition correction

The provisional **9d4c181** change keyed/remounted the main analytics plot on every timeframe/mode change and added an outer chart-stage animation. That disrupted the previously smooth Today <-> daily interpolation.

The accepted correction:
- Keeps one main chart instance across timeframe changes.
- Lets Recharts interpolate the data-series change directly.
- Slows the primary/secondary series animation to ~520 ms.
- Enables the same animation for intraday/Today secondary charts instead of disabling it with `isAnimationActive={!intraday}`.

This is presentation-only: it does not modify analytics observations, calculations, timeframe resolution, market data, or financial semantics.

### Full motion audit correction

User validation of the first accepted Phase 4 pass found:
- general control/overlay timing still felt too fast;
- Trading Performance filters felt even faster than the surrounding motion;
- tabs animated the incoming page but had no visible outgoing transition;
- Transaction filters changed results with no transition;
- Edit Transaction entered correctly but disappeared instantly on close.

The audit changed the architecture from entrance-only animation to coordinated old -> new / exit transitions.

Representative audit commits:
- **aec8fe3** — shared visual-transition coordinator
- **1419389** — true outgoing-to-incoming tab transitions
- **ca0b21b** — outgoing transitions + slower canonical cadence
- **0aeac2b** — true Trading Performance filter transitions
- **39f1de4**, **aa9a022** — Transaction filter/result transition and modal-exit work
- **71f71e3** — unified premium modal snapshot exit
- **fa73eef** — Edit Transaction exit unified with overlay family
- **d43bf85** — Cash Edit modal exit
- modal-exit coverage added across Add Trade, Sell, Edit Position, Quick Cash, confirmation, Alerts, Sheets, Schema Sync, Backup, and Screenshot flows
- **ccc39e1** — Cash action/history result transitions
- **972c170** — Closed Cycle result transitions
- **dca8e2d** — Monthly report result transitions
- **e0bba21** — Open Positions sector-result transition
- **6b6b728** — Ticker Directory sector-result transition
- **16692d3**, **140bf5d**, **70231d2** and related commits — remove legacy fast local durations and normalize helper motion
- **e0e33e9** — flush React state before native transition snapshots for deterministic old/new capture

### Coverage implemented so far

- Family 1: active navigation plus genuine outgoing -> incoming main-tab transitions.
- Family 2: shared actions, icon actions, selectors, controls, dropdown triggers, accordion triggers, form fields, chevrons, and toggles use audited timing.
- Family 3: dropdown/menu entrances, modal entrances, modal backdrops, and premium modal exits.
- Family 4: Cash Deposit/Withdraw, Cash history, Closed Cycle filters, Transaction filters, Edit Transaction BUY/SELL sections, allocation state changes, Trading Performance filters, Monthly filters, Positions sector filters, Directory sector filters, feedback/state banners, and accordion reveals.
- Family 5: primary unified analytics chart and all secondary Risk & Cost chart series.



### Screen-recording deep audit — mobile + desktop

Two real recordings were reviewed frame-by-frame after the audit pass:

- iPhone/mobile recording: ~71.4 s at ~55.8 fps, 1320×2868.
- Desktop Chrome recording: ~50.3 s at 24 fps, 1920×1200.

The recordings exposed problems that were not obvious from static code review:

- Browser View Transition snapshots painted old and new application trees simultaneously, producing visible duplicate cards, duplicated report headings, ghosted controls, and stale content overlays.
- Several tab/filter changes contained near-empty midpoint frames because the outgoing snapshot faded before the incoming snapshot became readable.
- Snapshot geometry interpolation interacted badly with long responsive pages and current scroll position, producing apparent jumps/crops on phone.
- A large tab wrapper was permanently promoted with `will-change` / `translateZ(0)`, forcing expensive raster/compositor work over very tall mobile pages.
- Nested/legacy entrance animations could replay inside a parent transition, making a single state change look like several unrelated appearances.
- Rapid repeated state changes could complete one animation while a newer request was pending, allowing an older cached tree to flash back before the next transition began.
- Modal exits were inconsistent: some used presence, some instant unmount, and some retained legacy exit classes.

#### Recording-driven correction — historical, superseded by v3

The accepted architecture is now **single-tree sequential motion**:

`current tree exits in place -> React swaps once -> latest requested tree enters`

No app-content transition uses browser full-page snapshots.

Implementation:
- **943ff47 / 9ef1e28 / 619275d** — retire snapshot-based app-content transitions and introduce deterministic motion primitives.
- **9f22b49** — deterministic tab exit/swap/enter.
- **8a2e48f** — duplicate-free Transaction filter swaps.
- **7f27137** — Trading Performance transitions one stable result tree.
- **e366256** — Monthly report swaps one stable tree.
- **368041c / cc0f827 / 9bac54c / 973504c** — stabilize Closed Cycles, Positions, Directory, and Cash result swaps.
- **963a1c6** — make the MotionSwap state machine resilient to rapid repeated state changes so an older tree cannot flash back.
- **a6767d2** — reduce midpoint disappearance, remove permanent whole-page GPU promotion, reduce mobile displacement, and fully neutralize retired `view-transition-name` behavior.
- **22a3eef** — unify modal exit behavior without snapshot compositing; presence-aware overlays keep their React exit, legacy overlays receive a short DOM exit before their normal close callback.
- **f981a5e / b39fdbf** — repair MotionSwap wrapper markup found by CI during the recording-driven rewrite.

The revised transition midpoint intentionally remains partially visible instead of fading near zero:
- tabs meet around ~46–52% opacity;
- state/result changes meet around ~58–62% opacity.

This masks the single React swap without creating duplicate layers or a blank flash.

The chart family remains unchanged because the user had already validated Today <-> daily main/secondary chart interpolation as correct.


### Phase 4 v3 — Motion for React reimplementation

After the recording-driven stability rewrite removed ghosting/duplication, user validation found that the timer-based sequential system had over-corrected: major transitions became too subtle and often read as plain state replacement.

A dedicated implementation plan was created first:

- **680c6f2** — add `docs/PHASE4_MOTION_REIMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

The v3 architecture makes **Motion for React** (`motion@12.23.24`) the sole lifecycle orchestration layer.

Core rules:
- `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` owns main tab and keyed result replacement.
- Real DOM nodes remain mounted for exit; no browser View Transition screenshots.
- No timer-driven cached React trees.
- `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` honors accessibility preferences.
- CSS owns hover/focus/press/semantic transitions only.
- Recharts remains the sole owner of analytics-series interpolation.
- Each interaction has one lifecycle-motion owner.

Representative implementation commits:
- **8a79c5a** — add root Motion accessibility configuration.
- **2afb3b5** — rebuild `MotionSwap` and shared presence primitives on Motion for React.
- **ec8c619** — make Motion authoritative over lifecycle CSS.
- **1da5852**, **cbcad89**, **fd06213** — migrate Add Trade, Quick Cash, and confirmation overlays.
- **a87f265** — add bidirectional Motion presence to shared AnalyticsSelect dropdowns.
- **ed26181** — add bidirectional accordion presence to Closed Cycles.
- **221aae3**, **70f9044** — migrate Edit/Sell Position with retained visual data during exit.
- **05f8262**, **2eb1cd5**, **20e8dc1**, **bb86319**, **b131138** — migrate Alerts, Sheets, Schema Sync, Backup, and Screenshot overlays.
- **9c8f0da**, **a4b5d7c** — animate modal-internal tab/result changes.
- **00e08a3**, **76081fd** — migrate Transaction/Cash inline editors to Motion presence.
- **f848399** — physically remove obsolete snapshot/timer-era Phase 4 lifecycle CSS systems.
- **6ac6041** — add canonical shared dropdown presence and remove the compatibility presence hook.
- **20f6b29** — remove legacy DOM-query/timer transition orchestration; state updates are immediate and Motion owns presentation lifecycle.
- **5cfe67e**, **dcf709e** — migrate ticker suggestions and analytics mode menu to Motion dropdown presence.
- **5429959** and related commits — remove historical page-entry classes from active React code.

Repository-wide v3 audit result:
- zero React usages of `premium-section-enter`;
- zero React usages of `premium-content-swap`;
- zero React usages of `premium-reveal`;
- zero React usages of the retired `useMotionPresence` hook;
- zero React browser View Transition calls;
- zero React legacy modal-exit classes.

Current v3 choreography:
- tabs: ~220 ms exit + ~380 ms enter;
- result/state swaps: ~180 ms exit + ~310 ms enter;
- modal: ~330 ms enter / ~240 ms exit;
- dropdown: ~240 ms enter / ~170 ms exit;
- localized surfaces: ~260 ms enter / ~180 ms exit;
- charts: validated ~520 ms Recharts interpolation, unchanged.

### Phase 4 v3 choreography refinement

A second phone/desktop recording review found the Motion architecture safe but not yet visually smooth enough. Main findings:
- `mode="wait"` produced a visible old-tree exit -> replacement -> new-tree entrance cut;
- result-surface height changes were not visually integrated with presence;
- dropdowns were too fast;
- modal entrances were too subtle relative to their size;
- the 1W chart transition remained noticeably less smooth than other ranges because the short weekly daily series has a much smaller point count/domain than Today/monthly ranges.

Implemented corrections:
- **b021260** — switch tab/result presence to `mode="popLayout"`, add controlled overlap, and animate state-result container size;
- **744c9cf / 6d80ac5** — centralize all dropdown timing and move AnalyticsSelect onto the shared slower dropdown presence;
- **f71e742 / 31049e6** — introduce 1W chart-boundary crossfade and secondary-chart parity;
- **1167b25 / 736ae04** — isolate SVG gradient definitions while old/new weekly-boundary charts overlap;
- **f597b66** — scope layout measurement to actual result-key changes;
- **8beffa9** — align canonical motion tokens to the choreography pass.

Current choreography targets:
- tabs: ~280 ms outgoing with ~440 ms incoming and a short controlled overlap;
- state/results: ~220 ms outgoing with ~360 ms incoming plus layout-size interpolation;
- dropdowns: ~360 ms in / ~240 ms out;
- modal panels: ~420 ms in / ~300 ms out;
- normal analytics timeframes: validated Recharts ~520 ms interpolation;
- 1W boundary: localized chart-system crossfade (~460 ms in / ~280 ms out) with inner series interpolation suppressed only during the boundary.

The 1W correction does **not** resample or invent intermediate financial data. Old and new real chart states are handed off visually as complete coordinate systems.

### Analytics chart rollback after choreography pass

The first choreography implementation attempted to special-case transitions crossing **1W** by crossfading complete chart coordinate systems. User validation immediately rejected this because it replaced the previously approved native Recharts curve morph with a generic fade and degraded **all analytics chart transitions** perceptually.

That approach is fully rolled back.

Rollback commits:
- **87bda85** — restore native primary analytics chart interpolation.
- **4938913** — restore native secondary analytics chart interpolation.

Current rule:
- all timeframe transitions again use the original continuous Recharts series interpolation at ~520 ms;
- no chart-level Motion fade/crossfade wrapper;
- no suppression of Recharts series animation;
- no alternate chart lifecycle system;
- the remaining **1W-only smoothness issue** is tracked separately and must be solved without changing the already-approved transitions for the other timeframes.

Phase 4 remains **in progress** pending fresh phone + desktop validation of the non-chart choreography and a separate surgical 1W investigation.


### 1W regression root cause — preserve the complete outgoing curve

The follow-up recording provided the decisive comparison:

- **Today -> 1M** is smooth because 1M has enough target points that Recharts preserves a detailed approximation of the outgoing Today curve during the first animation frame.
- **Today -> 1W** is not smooth because 1W has only a handful of daily points. Recharts' normal matching reduces the complete outgoing curve to that tiny target point count before interpolation begins. The first visible frame therefore loses most of the outgoing shape and becomes a broad simplified hill.

This explains why fixing only X placement improved the right-quarter artifact but did not make 1W feel like Today <-> 1M.

The final correction stays inside the existing mounted Recharts Area/Line lifecycle:

- 1W crossings use key matching only to retain **all previous and next rendered points** for the transition calculation;
- the custom `animationInterpolateFn` reconstructs the complete outgoing and incoming profiles;
- both profiles are transition-only sampled to at least 24 points (capped at 96);
- source and target Y geometry are sampled across normalized chart width;
- Today source/target geometry uses linear sampling;
- daily source/target geometry uses a cardinal spline matching the chart's 0.55 tension;
- intermediate X coordinates span the complete target plot from the first frame;
- at animation completion Recharts returns the untouched real target dataset;
- final 1W points, calculations, tooltips, axes, and financial observations are unchanged;
- ordinary non-1W transitions remain on the default Recharts interpolation path;
- secondary analytics were restored to their already-approved native interpolation until the main 1W behavior is visually approved.

Representative commits:
- **f9c5852** — preserve complete previous/next profiles and add curve-aware transition sampling.
- **6f850de** — use the full-profile interpolator only for main-chart 1W crossings.
- **e7825cf** — restore secondary analytics to approved native interpolation.

Quality Checks #502 passed typecheck, tests, and production build for the final implementation.

### Desktop motion-performance optimization

Phone validation was smooth while desktop/PC showed frame stutter during tab and state transitions. Code audit identified desktop-specific render cost rather than a need to weaken the choreography:

- desktop state/result swaps were using Motion `layout="size"` plus child `layout="position"` across large tables/reports;
- main tab transitions briefly render old/new heavy desktop trees together;
- tiny whole-page scale transforms forced raster resampling of large glass-heavy pages;
- controls still carried persistent `will-change: transform` hints from older passes;
- moving result trees applied blanket `backface-visibility: hidden` to nested tables/cards/panels, encouraging unnecessary compositor layers.

The optimization preserves the visible Phase 4 motion while lowering desktop cost:

- desktop is detected with `(min-width: 1024px) and (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`;
- phone/tablet behavior is unchanged;
- desktop state/result swaps keep the same opacity/y enter-exit choreography but disable Motion layout projection;
- desktop main tabs keep the same opacity/x/y choreography but remove the nearly invisible scale component to avoid full-page raster resampling;
- persistent per-control `will-change` is removed;
- blanket nested `backface-visibility` promotion is removed;
- Motion shells use `contain: layout style` to reduce layout/style invalidation without clipping glass/shadows;
- ordinary row hover motion remains intact.

Representative commits:
- **324498a** — reduce desktop Motion layout/raster cost.
- **7364d4d** — reduce compositor pressure and remove persistent layer hints.
- **cfa29d9** — preserve row hover motion after compositor cleanup.

The analytics chart implementation, including the approved 1W full-profile fix, is not changed by this performance pass.

### Heavy-tab desktop scheduling and paint deferral

Follow-up desktop testing showed the remaining stutter was strongest when entering tabs with large synchronous render/paint cost, especially Overview/Open Positions/Reports.

A second PC-only optimization layer was added without changing visible transition timing:

- desktop tab selection is wrapped in `React.startTransition`, allowing React to render the heavy incoming tree as concurrent work rather than monopolizing the main thread immediately;
- phone/tablet tab updates remain immediate and unchanged;
- desktop `.premium-table-shell` and `.premium-report-table` surfaces use `content-visibility: auto` so off-screen heavy tables are not fully rasterized while the incoming tab animates;
- `contain-intrinsic-size` supplies stable placeholder geometry and remembers real dimensions after layout;
- layout/style containment is applied to heavy table/report surfaces to reduce invalidation spread.

Representative commits:
- **2289337** — schedule heavy desktop tab mounts concurrently.
- **ee95f08** — add off-screen desktop table/report paint deferral.
- **2c0018d** — scope paint containment to table surfaces only so floating dropdown/report-glass overflow remains unaffected.

The transition choreography, chart interpolation, phone behavior, and row/control micro-interactions are unchanged.

### Final desktop pass and chart-entry scheduling

The final Phase 4 desktop pass focused on the remaining stutter entering **Overview**, **Open Positions**, and **Reports** without weakening the approved choreography.

Implemented:
- desktop PositionsTable no longer renders the complete desktop table and complete mobile card tree at the same time;
- position filtering/sector derivation and repeated currency formatting were moved off the hot path where practical;
- historical analytics stay warm across tab switches instead of clearing/refetching solely because the active tab changed;
- persistent summary/report/chart surfaces were memoized to avoid unrelated App updates rerendering large trees;
- the market-sync UI callback was stabilized so memoization remains effective;
- animated Recharts canvases in Overview/Reports are deferred until the incoming main-tab Motion transition reports completion, so tab motion and graph animation no longer compete at the same time.

Representative commits:
- **fe11ec8** — avoid duplicate position layouts on desktop.
- **5c4e668** — keep historical analytics warm across tab switches.
- **7e4474d / 30a5cee / 639576f / 325f609 / f72a1da / 918fa3f** — memoize persistent summary/report/chart surfaces.
- **9279682 / cba4a4b / b478ed5** — expose actual tab-motion completion and defer chart canvases until the tab settles.
- **13a4012 / f2fe4ad / 7926a39** — extend the same deferred-canvas behavior across report and secondary analytics charts.

Quality Checks passed typecheck, tests, and production build for the final chart-entry scheduling pass.

### Phase 4 completion

User validation accepted the current motion/performance balance as good enough to move forward. Motion is not perfectly stutter-free on desktop, but the remaining hitch is minor and is no longer a blocker.

**Phase 4 is complete.** Further PC motion/compositor optimization is intentionally deferred to **Phase 11**, after advanced effects, chart polish, header work, and the final consistency sweep establish the actual final rendering workload.

The next planned stage is **Phase 5 — Advanced effects**.

## Phase 5 — Advanced-effects audit and planning

**Implementation status: not started.**

Before any Phase 5 styling was changed, a full-app audit and detailed execution plan were completed to avoid the coverage and architecture problems encountered in earlier phases.

Audit scope:
- `src/App.tsx`;
- all 33 non-test TSX files under `src/components`;
- `src/index.css`;
- chart/report visual boundaries;
- current Phase 4 performance constraints.

Key findings:
- Phase 5 is not starting from zero: the app already has page auroras, `premium-radial`, an infinite `premium-shimmer-border`, semantic win/loss/breakeven/buy glows, multi-layer glass shadows, and custom modal/dropdown/report surfaces.
- The stylesheet has accumulated multiple historical generations of premium rules, so adding another bottom-of-file override system would repeat earlier cascade problems.
- The existing generic shimmer runs continuously on desktop and appears across many buttons/modal-related surfaces, making shimmer normalization a cleanup/refinement task rather than an opportunity to add more looping animation.
- The accepted Phase 4 desktop baseline still has minor residual stutter, so Phase 5 must use a strict compositor/effect budget.

The accepted Phase 5 architecture:
- retain at most the existing two continuous page-ambient elements;
- make static edge light/glass refraction the primary finishing effect;
- move sheen toward limited hover/focus-triggered use instead of continuous generic shimmer;
- keep semantic halo tied to real financial/system meaning;
- use shared effect-intensity tiers so dense tables/inputs/charts do not receive the same treatment as hero/floating surfaces;
- explicitly audit every component before Phase 5 can be marked complete.

A mandatory component coverage matrix and staged validation gates are documented in:
- **docs/PHASE5_ADVANCED_EFFECTS_PLAN.md**

Planning commit:
- **4233cb8** — add audited Phase 5 advanced-effects plan.

No Phase 5 CSS/component implementation was performed during this planning pass.

### Phase 5 Pass 0 — effect-system baseline

**Status: complete.**

The first implementation pass is deliberately visual-neutral. It establishes canonical effect ownership before any new Phase 5 treatment is introduced.

- **2d24dcd** — centralize Phase 5 effect primitives.
- Existing ambient blur/opacity, radial-hover values, and shimmer palette/timing are now named CSS custom properties.
- Repeated card semantic-halo recipes were consolidated into one shared recipe with per-state semantic variables.
- Repeated compact report semantic-halo recipes were consolidated the same way.
- No new effect, animation, blur, glow intensity, layout, or Phase 4 lifecycle timing was introduced.

Quality Checks #539 passed typecheck, tests, and production build. Pass 0 is complete.

### Phase 5 Pass 1 — representative static-refraction checkpoint

**Status: revised after user validation; stronger representative primitive awaiting re-validation before rollout.**

A reusable static refraction primitive was implemented without adding blur or animation:
- **3bcee3d** — `premium-refraction` with default, hero, and overlay intensity variants.
- The primitive uses an optional inset-shadow slot already consumed by the relevant shared surface recipes, avoiding pseudo-element collisions with `premium-radial`, modal decoration, and dropdown decoration.

Representative applications only:
- **00afaf0** — Total Portfolio Value hero.
- **08ad05d** — Portfolio Allocation report panel.
- **73cbd6b** — Quick Cash modal shell.
- **2011e71** — AnalyticsSelect dropdown shell.

No broader component rollout has occurred yet. This is the planned Checkpoint B: one hero, one report surface, one modal, and one dropdown must be visually accepted on desktop/phone before the shared primitive is expanded to the full coverage matrix.

Quality Checks #544 passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

User feedback: the first static-refraction treatment was **too subtle**. The response was intentionally architectural rather than component-specific:
- **5dd2bfa** — strengthen the shared refraction token/primitive values only;
- brighter static 1px spectral rims were added;
- faint static inner cyan/purple edge falloff was added;
- the same four representative surfaces remain the only Phase 5 refraction applications;
- no new blur, animation, pseudo-element, or broader rollout was introduced.

The stronger checkpoint now requires fresh visual approval before Pass 1 expands.

### Phase 5 Pass 1 completion

The strengthened refraction checkpoint was visually accepted.

Full rollout was then performed through shared surface roles rather than manual JSX decoration:
- **3fb75b8** — canonical refraction tiers for hero, primary, secondary/inset, and overlay surfaces; data-dense tables/rows/fields/chart plots remain Tier 0.
- **5e54a17 / 4d66a94 / 522666b / 017bc77** — remove temporary checkpoint-only classes from the representative hero/report/modal/dropdown surfaces so they inherit the shared system.

Quality Checks #551 passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

**Pass 1 is complete.**

### Phase 5 Pass 2 — CTA aurora-border normalization

**Status: complete.**

The initial component-only audit found **17 active `premium-shimmer-border` uses**; Pass 4 found the additional eligible + Add Position use in `src/App.tsx`, making the correct original total **18**. They divide into:
- eligible high-value primary CTAs: Add Trade/Open Position, deposit/update/restore/log/connect/sync/install confirmations;
- routine edit/save actions that should not shimmer;
- warning/danger actions that must keep their amber/rose semantics rather than receive generic cyan/purple sheen.

Implemented:
- **e851bca** — first attempt removed the original 5.5 s border-flow loop and replaced it with a 720 ms hover/focus sweep.
- User validation rejected that behavior because it read as a fast flash.
- **46e6351** — second attempt used a slower recurring moving light band, but user clarified that this still represented the wrong effect family.
- **9d07c8c** — restore the actual original visual: a continuously shifting blue/cyan/purple aurora/iridescent gradient around the CTA perimeter at the original 5.5 s cadence.
- The historical `premium-shimmer-border` class name remains for compatibility, but the accepted effect is now documented as **CTA aurora border flow**.
- Mobile/touch and reduced-motion disable the loop.
- Seven inappropriate uses remain removed:
  - **50c79f4** — Journal routine Save Changes.
  - **a170f33 / 3e74738 / 109d81b** — Cash audited warning, withdrawal danger, and routine edit save.
  - **204da43** — Edit Position routine target save.
  - **0bb93b1** — Sell confirmation warning.
  - **7992b78** — Delete confirmation danger.
- Eleven intentional high-value CTA aurora-border uses remain: App + Add Position, Header Add Trade, Positions Add Trade, Cash Deposit, Add Position/DCA, Quick Cash update, Google Sheets Save Connection, Python Validate & Sync, Backup restore, Trade Screenshot log, and PWA install.
- Continuous background-position motion is intentionally restored only for those 10 audited CTAs because that perimeter-flow effect is the approved visual.

Quality Checks #558 passed for the rejected hover-triggered version. Quality Checks #560 passed for the rejected moving-band version. Quality Checks #564 passed typecheck, tests, and production build for the restored aurora-border implementation. User validation accepted the restored aurora/iridescent perimeter flow. **Pass 2 is complete.**

### Phase 5 Pass 3 — semantic & ambient refinement

**Status: complete.**

First implementation:
- **418870d** — unify win/loss/breakeven/buy semantics around one shared RGB palette and hierarchy-driven halo intensity.
  - hero semantic cards are the strongest state surfaces;
  - ordinary semantic cards are lower;
  - compact report/subpanel semantic states are lower again;
  - desktop table rows remain edge-only and use the same canonical palette;
  - report hero/hero-metric state depth now aligns explicitly with dashboard hero depth.
- The existing two desktop page auroras were calmed rather than expanded: blur 72px -> 76px, opacity 0.82 -> 0.74, and motion/scale travel reduced.
- **30e1f3a** — Offline banner is static while its icon alone pulses to communicate the real offline state.
- **76c584a** — remove the header's decorative always-on ping; token-expired Google Sheets warning now pulses only its warning icon instead of the whole button.
- A full audit of all 33 component TSX files confirmed remaining pulse/spin/bounce motion is tied to actual state rather than decorative financial sign.
- **eb5bf1a** — Price Alerts footer now reports Service Worker Auto-Sync as Active/Inactive and only pulses when permission is granted and alerts are enabled.

State-motion policy after this pass:
- session-active pulse remains because it maps to the actual EGX session state;
- sync/loading spinners remain while work is actually running;
- unread-alert bounce remains tied to unread alerts;
- target-hit/stop-loss pulses remain because they are actionable threshold alerts;
- ordinary positive/negative financial state never pulses merely because of P&L sign;
- inactive status surfaces are static.

Quality Checks #577 passed typecheck, tests, and production build on the final Pass 3 code head.

User validation accepted the semantic/ambient balance and status-motion restraint. **Pass 3 is complete.**

### Phase 5 Pass 4 — full-app coverage sweep

**Status: complete.**

The sweep covered `src/App.tsx` plus all **33** non-test component TSX files.

Coverage fixes:
- **887d9e0** — add shared premium status-surface primitive.
- **1dc8b6f** — migrate Offline/Firestore quota banners to that shared status surface.
- **e406ba6** — migrate the previously legacy Supabase auth/checking UI onto premium page/glass/field/action/semantic-error primitives.
- **11c3206** — initial migration moved all three Secondary Analytics legacy opaque card shells to shared report glass while leaving Recharts internals for Phase 7.
- User validation found the Risk & Cost cards still visually out of place because `premium-report-glass-soft` is intentionally an inset/secondary tier while the main analytics chart uses `premium-panel`.
- **53edb8a** — move all three Risk & Cost cards to `premium-panel`, matching the primary analytics material hierarchy without touching chart data, animation, or Recharts internals.
- **ceff46c** — make Header glass consume the shared Phase 5 primary refraction slot without changing Header layout/composition.

Audit findings:
- Pass 2's count was incomplete because it omitted `App.tsx`: the correct original aurora-class count is **18**, split into **11 eligible kept** and **7 removed**.
- Remaining raw slate borders/backgrounds are separators, table headers, hover states, loading skeletons, or chart/logo internals rather than missed surface containers.
- Small local icon/logo gradients remain intentional identity graphics.
- `StockLogo` remains intentionally excluded; `PremiumMotion` remains frozen; chart plot internals remain Phase 7.

Quality Checks **#587** passed typecheck, tests, and production build on the final Pass 4 code head.

The complete 34-file disposition matrix is maintained in `docs/PHASE5_ADVANCED_EFFECTS_PLAN.md`.

User validation accepted the corrected Risk & Cost hierarchy and the full coverage sweep. **Pass 4 is complete.**

### Phase 5 Pass 5 — final validation

**Status: complete.**

Final validation results:
- Quality Checks **#592** passed typecheck, tests, and production build.
- Compare against the pre-Phase-5 head shows presentation-only scope: docs, `src/index.css`, and UI component files only; no service/accounting/persistence/type/data-engine files changed.
- No chart interpolation implementation changed. The only chart-component Phase 5 code change was the Secondary Analytics **outer shell class hierarchy**.
- Continuous animation is limited to the two existing page auroras plus the explicitly approved high-value CTA aurora-border loop.
- Both page ambience and CTA aurora loops require desktop width and `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`; reduced motion disables them.
- Mobile disables radial hover lighting and uses reduced static blur/depth.
- Phase 5 effect pseudo-elements are pointer-transparent.
- No persistent `will-change` or compositor-promotion hack was introduced.
- Open dropdown parents retain explicit z-index/overflow elevation rules.
- Semantic P&L state remains non-pulsing; remaining status motion maps to actual live/actionable state.
- User visual validation accepted refraction strength, CTA aurora flow, semantic/ambient balance, the 34-file coverage corrections, and the final Risk & Cost card hierarchy.

**Phase 5 is complete.**

The Phase 5 detailed plan is now historical. Phase 6 — Mobile / responsive refinement — is next.

## Phase 6 — Responsive audit and planning

**Status: complete. Pass 6 code audit, Quality Checks #745, and final real-device responsive smoke are accepted.**

Detailed plan:
- **8662376** — add `docs/PHASE6_RESPONSIVE_REFINEMENT_PLAN.md`.

Audit coverage:
- `src/App.tsx` plus all **33** non-test component TSX files;
- current responsive/media-query layer in `src/index.css`;
- persistent shell, fixed notifications/status, modal/overlay families, filters/selectors, tables, report surfaces, shared controls, and chart shells.

Key findings:
- **Touch target debt:** many shared actions/nav/filter/segment/icon controls are around 30–34px high on mobile. `NumberStepperInput` is especially problematic because its 32px-wide side control is split into two very small buttons. `DateInput` also has a compact calendar trigger.
- **Modal viewport inconsistency:** some complex modals are already scroll-safe, but the long Portfolio Backup modal has no outer scroll/max-height contract. Several shorter modals also rely on content fitting the viewport rather than a shared `dvh` safety rule.
- **Fixed overlay risk:** App undo/toast surfaces and Offline/Firestore status surfaces are fixed to screen corners without a shared mobile max-width/safe-area contract.
- **Minimum-width pressure:** Closed Cycles, Positions, Directory, Journal, and report selectors use fixed minimum widths that can become awkward inside 320px padded containers.
- **Report/chart mobile contract:** chart series themselves are out of scope, but tooltip minimum widths, timeframe/selector target sizes, fixed chart heights, and report action groups require responsive refinement.
- **Existing strengths:** Positions already has explicit desktop/mobile rendering, several modal families are already scroll-safe, report/cash tables already use horizontal overflow shells, and many forms/grids already stack correctly.
- **CSS gap:** existing `max-width: 767px` media rules mostly tune glass/motion cost; there is no canonical coarse-pointer touch-target layer, modal viewport primitive, or fixed-overlay width primitive yet.

Planned passes:
1. responsive primitives and safety baseline;
2. persistent shell/app chrome;
3. core data tabs;
4. full modal/overlay family;
5. reports/chart shells;
6. shared controls/rare states;
7. full 34-file responsive validation.

Hard boundaries:
- navigation architecture remains Phase 6.5;
- chart visual redesign/interpolation remains Phase 7;
- final hierarchy remains Phase 8;
- final header composition remains Phase 9;
- no business/accounting/persistence/data-engine changes.

No Phase 6 implementation code was changed during the audit/planning pass.

### Phase 6 Pass 0 — responsive primitives and safety baseline

**Status: implemented and CI-clean; awaiting mobile baseline validation before Pass 1.**

- **db4bcc3** — add shared responsive safety primitives to `src/index.css`.
- Phone/coarse-pointer shared action families now use a 44px minimum target without changing desktop density.
- Icon actions receive a 44x44 minimum touch box; shared fields/menu rows receive matching mobile/coarse-pointer sizing.
- `NumberStepperInput` is deliberately excluded from the generic control rule because its stacked +/- buttons need a dedicated Pass 5 treatment.
- Add opt-in `dvh`-aware modal viewport/body-scroll helpers rather than globally forcing overflow behavior onto every existing modal.
- Add fixed-overlay max-width and mobile width/min-width helper primitives for Passes 1–5.
- Mobile modal backdrop padding now respects safe-area insets.
- Mobile dropdowns are globally capped to viewport width/height and contain overscroll.
- No screen-specific responsive component code changed in this pass.
- Quality Checks **#600** passed typecheck, tests, and production build.

User validation accepted the Pass 0 touch-sizing/mobile baseline. **Pass 0 is complete.**

### Phase 6 Pass 1 — persistent shell and main app chrome

**Status: complete.**

Scope: `App.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `PortfolioSummary.tsx`, and `OfflineIndicator.tsx`.

Implemented:
- **ae08150** — add safe-area-aware mobile fixed-overlay positioning helpers and 44px minimum width for shared touch actions.
- **24ac8d2** — make App undo/toast content viewport-clamped and wrap-safe.
- **dbe2a30** — make the mobile Header utility strip horizontally scrollable instead of multi-row wrapping; persistent navigation remains the existing horizontal rail.
- **3a625d8** — reduce phone summary padding/gap pressure, preserve the 2-column KPI grid, hide low-priority mobile annotations, and allow long semantic values/footer details to wrap.
- **132295e** — make Offline/Firestore banners span the safe mobile gutter with a reachable independent Sync action.
- **3fd4190 / bf3cdd1** — place mobile notifications below the taller sticky Header and stack Undo above persistent status banners.
- **bc9e7f7** — keep fixed-overlay width clamping mobile-only to protect the accepted desktop baseline.
- User screenshot validation rejected the first mobile Header composition because several button contents were optically off-center and migration-era controls were still exposed.
- **05f2316 / 2f1ed56 / 8019ca1** — remove the manual database Force Sync header action and standalone Google/Firebase Sign In/avatar/Sign Out controls. Supabase authentication gates the app; Supabase persistence/realtime sync owns portfolio storage; optional Google auth remains scoped to the Google Sheets modal. Center the remaining six phone actions and move mobile status/count decoration out of normal icon flow.
- **5c44fdb** — remove the obsolete Firestore-quota banner branch from `OfflineIndicator`; the compatibility shim exposes no active Firestore quota behavior after migration.
- **1928172** — apply the user-requested mobile Positions card action correction ahead of formal Pass 2: sector metadata moves into the identity line and DCA/Sell/Edit/Delete share one compact row, eliminating the lone Delete row and unnecessary card height.
- Accepted follow-up direction: treat Backup/Reconcile as a **maintenance/data-recovery utility**, not a permanent Header action. Keep the underlying export/restore/reconciliation tools, but relocate their entry point into a future Data Management/Settings surface rather than leaving them in the primary mobile header.
- Track stale migration copy in `PortfolioBackupModal`: the restore success message still says Firebase and must be updated to Supabase/cloud-neutral wording when the modal is revised in Phase 6 Pass 3.

Boundaries preserved:
- no navigation IA/active-state redesign (Phase 6.5);
- no final Header redesign (Phase 9);
- no business/data/motion/chart changes.

Quality Checks **#620** passed typecheck, tests, and production build on the revised Pass 1 state. User validation accepted Pass 1.

### Phase 6 Pass 2 — core data tabs

**Status: complete.**

Scope: Positions, Closed Cycles, Transactions/Journal, Cash Ledger, and Stocks & Prices.

Implementation:
- **c387712 / fb6d709** — make the Positions tab header responsive and hide its redundant phone-only + Add Position entry point while retaining the integrated Add Trade control.
- **221b7d9 / 0f3639b** — make Positions search/filter controls shrink safely, tighten phone card padding, preserve the desktop/mobile split, and finalize the compact DCA/Sell/Edit/Delete row.
- **3b769ab** — remove Closed Cycles fixed mobile search/sort widths and make the surrounding controls responsive.
- User validation caught a visual regression: Closed Cycles outcome filters no longer matched the accepted Transactions selector family.
- **f5b9c7d** — restore the exact shared selector language used by Transactions: `premium-selector-shell`, `premium-filter-pill`, semantic active states, `aria-pressed`, and matching selected-state glow/motion. Phone layout is a horizontal selector rail, not a separate 2×2 visual design.
- **94c533f / 795db90** — make Journal filters a deliberate horizontal rail, make sort/page-size controls two-column on phone, clamp delete toast width, and make both pagination control rows phone-safe.
- **7243d37 / 830f2f3 / 4dd7f71** — make Cash transfer/history selectors phone-safe while preserving the canonical selector-shell styling; give the ledger table an explicit in-shell horizontal-scroll width rather than letting the page widen.
- **0b8af54** — make Directory utility actions, sector filtering, and card padding responsive without altering ticker-card information architecture.

No Phase 2 implementation changed accounting, persistence, transaction semantics, or chart logic. Desktop minimum widths remain at larger breakpoints where they are useful.

**Regression rule added:** Phase 6 owns responsive layout and reachability, not visual-language reinvention. Existing accepted selector/action primitives must be preserved; Transactions is the canonical dense semantic filter reference.

Quality Checks **#647** passed typecheck, tests, and production build on the corrected Pass 2 state.

### Phase 6 Pass 3 — modal and overlay family

**Status: corrective implementation complete; awaiting CI and mobile re-validation.**

Scope: Portfolio Backup, Edit Position, Quick Cash, Confirm Delete, Add Trade, Sell Position, Journal edit, Cash edit, Google Sheets, Schema Sync, Price Alerts, Trade Screenshot, and PWA install surfaces.

Implementation:
- **ff28126** — add `premium-modal-frame` alongside the existing `premium-modal-viewport` / `premium-modal-scroll-body` primitives, all bounded by mobile `dvh` and safe-area gutters.
- **6c02593** — fix Portfolio Backup's long-phone/short-landscape clipping, mobile action stacking, and stale Firebase restore copy.
- **0c848aa / 62fd38e / d69d0a7** — viewport-safe Edit Position, Quick Cash, and Confirm Delete.
- **edce550 / 3e9081e** — viewport-safe Add/Sell forms with narrow form-grid collapse and reachable action rows.
- **6803097 / e5630f3** — viewport-safe Journal Edit and Cash Edit while preserving existing selector/choice styling.
- **c0f6844** — Google Sheets uses fixed header + shared scroll body inside `premium-modal-frame`; narrow account/URL/rebuild rows stack safely.
- **18240f3** — Schema Sync is viewport-safe; sub-tabs become an internal horizontal rail and schema/reference grids collapse on phone.
- **b586167** — Price Alerts moves from hard `90vh` to the shared frame/body contract; header, permission controls, tab rail, and footer remain reachable.
- **cd96b6a** — Screenshot Scanner moves from hard `90vh` to the shared frame/body contract with responsive review/footer action composition.
- **7f18d1d** — PWA guide receives the same structured modal contract.
- User testing on the deployed phone build found Add Trade and Transaction Edit had a nested-scroll ownership bug: the receipt shortcut / BUY-SELL selector could move above the reachable viewport and iOS overscroll would spring back.
- **24986ff / 9ade473 / 682deea** — add a phone-only panel-owned scroll backdrop contract. The backdrop is safe-area top anchored and non-scrollable on mobile; the `premium-modal-viewport` panel becomes the sole vertical scroller. This targets the spring-back failure without changing modal styling.
- User also reported ticker-master correctness issues. External verification confirmed NAPR is National Printing and KORA is Korra for Energy and Investment Projects. **276cfb7 / 262ac1c / 0053738 / 5f07095 / 54f6a61 / de9557e** add NAPR, correct KORA, canonicalize TradingView ISIN symbols back to known EGX tickers, merge saved/Supabase directories with the current master baseline, and repair stale position/transaction display metadata. This is a deliberate data-correctness exception to Phase 6's visual-only scope.
- **f01dd96** adds regression tests for the ticker canonicalization/repair path.
- User clarified that the requirement is the whole ticker directory, not only NAPR/KORA. The directory architecture was therefore changed from a small static source of truth to **live-scanner authoritative + static fallback**.
- **4c72efa / bb3c9a4 / b840b93 / 3651257** — add live metadata fields/sector categories, central historical aliases, retired fallback filtering, known current identity/ISIN corrections, and scanner sector/industry classification mapping.
- **1f5cc09 / 6755eb0** — TradingView Egypt scanning now requests name/description, sector, industry, ISIN and currency for the full scanner range. Every returned EGP security with a usable quote can update/add its directory record; scanner metadata overrides stale fallback metadata. USD alternate share classes are excluded from this EGP-denominated portfolio.
- **e838494** — rehydrate refreshed ticker identity across positions, transactions and closed cycles.
- **0c30598 / e0ffa88** — support ISIN search in Add Trade and the ticker directory.
- **8f6df6b** — do not invent Arabic labels for newly discovered securities without a curated Arabic fallback.
- **8bc4bdf / 8e44acd** — add tests covering current aliases, retired rows/cache cleanup, corrected baseline identities, live-metadata precedence and live-only discoveries.
- **a359617** — remove stale non-migratable rows from previously persisted ticker directories while retaining historical ledger records, and prefer canonical/current live records when aliases collapse.

Resulting contract: the app no longer needs a hand-maintained static row for every active EGX ticker. The static dictionary provides offline fallback/Arabic names/historical migration; the live scanner continuously supplies the current EGP market universe and authoritative market metadata.

Quality Checks **#692** passed typecheck, the expanded ticker regression suite, and production build.

Historical coverage repair:
- Production data inspection after adding ACTF showed ACTF had **zero daily and zero intraday history rows**. This explained the chart's four excluded valuation dates; the analytics engine correctly refuses to substitute a current quote into historical NAV.
- ACTF is intentionally left untouched as the end-to-end test fixture.
- **90ba3fa / dc40c9b** — add deterministic historical coverage planning/tests for initial backfill, missing-head, internal-gap, stale-tail, weekend, and healthy coverage cases.
- **03fcb0e** — make the server-side historical sync coverage-aware and self-healing. Required ranges come from transactions + open positions; repairs use canonical ticker resolution with ISIN fallback and write only the needed date range.
- **e4310db** — schedule the gap-aware repair repeatedly through the post-close/evening window and expose optional manual workflow inputs for targeted repair validation.
- **9d4593b / 1d2be35 / 5762cab** — fix the weekend test fixture and harden Supabase coverage paging for long portfolios with deterministic ordering.
- Data-integrity boundary: no ACTF history has been manually inserted. The repair must populate ACTF only when the normal historical-repair workflow is deliberately run for validation.

Quality Checks **#702** passed typecheck, tests, and production build. A direct Supabase read after the implementation still shows **0 ACTF daily history rows**, preserving the requested test fixture.

Regression boundary:
- no Phase 3 modal visual styling was replaced;
- no accepted selector/action/semantic/glow treatment was reinvented;
- no accounting, persistence, OCR, Sheets, notification, or transaction behavior changed;
- Pass 3 is responsive fit/reachability only.

### Phase 6 Pass 4 — reports and chart shells

**Status: implemented with real-device corrections; full pass logic/UI state documented in the dedicated Phase 6 plan.**

Implemented:
- make shared analytics tooltips, chart shells, selectors, report action bars, and dense report tables fit phone/tablet widths without changing chart observations/interpolation;
- delay four-column institutional KPI layouts until 2XL and keep compact navigation labels below that breakpoint;
- replace dense phone/tablet benchmark rows with hero-tier responsive scorecards while preserving the desktop institutional table;
- render Monthly Audit rows as one-record-per-card on phone/tablet and retain the full table on 2XL desktop;
- keep the Monthly Audit outer month shell neutral and structurally non-interactive so semantic glow belongs to its individual win/loss/holding records rather than conflicting with nested cards;
- correct touch scrolling so the structural Monthly Audit shell never competes with inner cards for hover/lift behavior;
- fix the discovered Monthly Audit summary mismatch so All = visible closed + holdings, Liquidated = closed only, Holdings = holdings only, search filtering is reflected, open-position P&L uses canonical fee-inclusive accounting, and closed win rate excludes breakevens.

Representative commits:
- **db66d31 / 7644ee7 / 742e97f** — report/chart responsive corrections and hero-tier benchmark cards;
- **41cee6a / 2f4a920 / 67eabe2** — one-record-per-card Monthly Audit renderer and reusable responsive report hero-card surface;
- **5867fb4 / af4375e / 35fdf7f** — neutral/non-interactive Monthly Audit structural shell and touch-scroll correction;
- **e85c8f2 / c18af7a / d5caf60** — canonical visible-record monthly summary helper, regression coverage, and filter-aware accounting integration;
- **8f77ea8 / 12f9751** — implementation/testing documentation for the monthly accounting correction.

Latest Pass 4 quality gate after the accounting correction: **28/28 test files, 173/173 tests, typecheck, production Vite build, and bundled server build**.

### Phase 6 Pass 5 — shared controls and rare states

**Status: implemented; awaiting the consolidated Pass 6 full responsive/device regression gate.**

Implemented:
- **f324da6 / 8eb025d** — geometry-aware shared `AnalyticsSelect` edge selection and viewport-width clamp, including live resize/orientation correction while open;
- **c3baaf9** — 44px native calendar hit target for `DateInput`;
- **073336b / 7a66b / 87c15d4 / 8f60c35** — full-height coarse-pointer +/- controls for `NumberStepperInput`, while desktop keeps the compact stacked stepper;
- **1ee4146** — `dvh`/keyboard-safe Supabase auth gate with phone input sizing that avoids focus zoom;
- **2ed96ca** — short-viewport-safe Error Boundary with wrap-safe diagnostics;
- **eb11566** — narrow-width-safe PWA install guide.

Regression boundary:
- no accounting, transaction, persistence, market-data, or chart-series behavior changed in Pass 5;
- accepted Phase 2–5 glass/glow/control styling remains the visual source of truth;
- Pass 5 changes shared interaction geometry and viewport fit only;
- fixed offline/status behavior stays with the completed Pass 1 implementation.

### Phase 6 Pass 6 — full responsive code audit and CI gate

**Status: code-level validation complete; real-device closure smoke pending.**

Audit:
- reviewed `src/App.tsx` and all **33** non-test component TSX files for fixed mobile widths, legacy viewport-height primitives, modal/overlay clipping risk, undersized direct controls, and tooltip/table containment;
- surviving fixed minimum widths are intentional: either responsive `sm/md+` desktop sizing or dense report/ledger table widths inside horizontal overflow shells;
- shared `premium-icon-action`, selector, action, and field primitives continue to provide the 44px coarse-pointer target contract;
- chart tooltip minimums remain below the supported 320px viewport cap;
- **d87ecfc** removes the remaining root `min-h-screen` usage and moves the app shell to `100dvh`.

Validation:
- temporary gate branch: `ci/phase6-pass6-responsive-audit-gate`;
- **Quality Checks #745 passed**;
- typecheck: passed;
- tests: **28/28 files, 173/173 tests passed**;
- production Vite build: passed in **6.23s**.

Final real-device responsive validation was accepted on 2026-09-25. Phase 6 is complete.

## Phase 6.5 — Navigation refinement

**Status: COMPLETE — Pass 3 hardening and Quality Checks #748 clean.**

Plan:
- **48c2f19** — add `docs/PHASE6_5_NAVIGATION_REFINEMENT_PLAN.md`.

Pass 1:
- **a256587** — replace seven duplicated Header tab blocks with one canonical grouped navigation definition while preserving the exact existing tab destinations/behavior.
- Navigation is grouped by task: **Portfolio** (Overview, Positions, Closed Cycles), **Activity** (Transactions, Cash Ledger), and **Insights** (Reports & Performance, Stocks & Prices).
- Existing active-tab auto-scroll is retained and now also refreshes overflow state after selection.
- Navigation overflow is measured rather than assumed; subtle left/right edge fades advertise hidden destinations only while content actually exists beyond that edge.
- Active tabs now inherit their destination accent for border, icon, underline, and restrained glow, producing clearer location hierarchy without making inactive tabs noisy.
- Desktop 2XL retains full destination labels; compact labels remain below 2XL.
- **a8deafc** — add shared Phase 6.5 navigation hierarchy, divider, semantic active-state, overflow-fade, and reduced-motion CSS.
- Phase 9 still owns final Header utility composition; this pass does not relocate or redesign Header utilities.
- User device review accepted the active-tab treatment but found group separators too subtle and phone tab transitions effectively imperceptible.
- **b69e01e** — retune canonical tab presence to a more readable 560ms entrance / 360ms exit with slightly stronger travel; reduced-motion behavior remains unchanged.
- **c1fa298** — strengthen task-group dividers to a 2px centered luminous separator while keeping them subordinate to active navigation.
- Separator treatment accepted on phone.
- Tab/page transition is slower and more visible than before but is **explicitly deferred for further work later**; do not treat current timing as final.
- **070db8b / fa495c4** — implement Pass 2 breakpoint/keyboard handoff: 2XL-only group labels/full labels, tighter phone density, roving arrow/Home/End keyboard focus, and reduced-motion-aware active-tab scrolling.
- **fefd19f** — remove breakpoint-forced fade hiding; overflow fades now depend only on measured scroll geometry, with proximity snap and mobile scroll padding.
- **b830803** — final Pass 3 hardening: active-tab visibility now scrolls only the navigation rail, every destination remains normally keyboard-tab-accessible, group semantics are explicit, and arrow/Home/End shortcuts remain available.
- Quality Checks **#748 passed**: typecheck, **28/28 test files / 173/173 tests**, and production build (**6.18s**).
- Phase 6.5 closes with the accepted phone navigation state. The current tab/page transition timing remains documented deferred motion debt; physical desktop/tablet visual smoke rolls into Phase 11 final regression rather than blocking navigation architecture completion.

## Phase 7 — Charts

**Status: IN PROGRESS — Pass 7.0 shared chart system implemented; validation running.**

- **2440ffd** — add `docs/PHASE7_CHARTS_PLAN.md`.
- Audit confirms **7 chart visualizations** across `PerformanceTimeframeChart`, `SecondaryAnalyticsCharts`, `RealizedTrajectoryChart`, and the allocation chart in `PerformanceReports`.
- Phase 7 is explicitly visual-only: analytics calculations, Today resolution/fallback logic, timeframe semantics, chart observations, 1W interpolation matching, Today linear paths, longer-range smoothing, synchronized chart behavior, and current series timing are protected.
- User clarification: cumulative Realized P&L trajectory points are **trade observations**, not decorative dots. Every trade marker must remain visible/inspectable and retain START/WIN/LOSS/BREAKEVEN identity.
- **ec35858** — encode the persistent trade-marker requirement into the Phase 7 plan.
- **6937a36 / 575b15a** — expand `AnalyticsChartTheme.tsx` into the Phase 7 shared visual layer: semantic chart tones, stable allocation palette, chart margins, zero-line recipe, active-point recipe, persistent trade-marker contract, plot surface, legend primitive, tooltip shell, and shared loading/empty treatment.
- **2942904** — add shared premium plot, tooltip, active-point, and loading-skeleton CSS with reduced-motion handling.
- **886eae1** — extend chart-theme tests to cover semantic colors, active-point separation, percentage-axis formatting, allocation palette stability, and all four persistent trajectory marker identities.
- Quality Checks **#749 passed** for Pass 7.0: typecheck, **28/28 test files / 178/178 tests**, production build **5.77s**.
- **8b27336** — start Pass 7.1 on the Unified Portfolio Analytics chart: shared plot surface, shared margins/zero-line/percent-axis formatting, and an explicit native legend for Portfolio vs Net Deposits. Analytics data, Today behavior, 1W morphing, syncId, curve rules, and series timing are untouched.
- Planned order remains: shared chart primitives → primary analytics → secondary analytics → realized trajectory → allocation → responsive/accessibility sweep → full regression closure.
- Portfolio Equity Bridge remains an analytical card surface, not a Phase 7 chart; its broader hierarchy remains for later phases.
- Phone tab/page transition timing remains separate deferred motion debt and is not folded into the chart phase.
- User requested jumping directly to **Pass 7.3 Realized P&L Trajectory** before 7.2; 7.2 remains pending.
- **26a2661 / 4aaa426 / 2bc5dcc** — migrate both trajectory modes onto the Phase 7 chart system while preserving all trade observations. Cumulative markers are persistent data-bearing points using START/WIN/LOSS/BREAKEVEN semantics; active markers preserve the selected trade's outcome; breakeven uses amber; overall trajectory stroke reflects net realized state; shared plot/axis/zero-line/tooltip/formatting primitives are applied; reduced-motion-safe marker emphasis added.
- Trajectory marker rule remains non-negotiable: one visible cumulative marker per inception/trade observation; no sampling, thinning, or markerless cumulative rendering.
- **d7e5512 / 1257c9d / ba9f50a / da7dc45** — add Realized Trajectory period filtering: **All, 1D, 1W, 1M, 90D, YTD**. Period windows reuse the canonical analytics timeframe/session logic; KPI summary, cumulative trajectory, persistent trade markers, and trade-by-trade bars all use the selected closed-trade set. Tests cover each period.
- **cba299b / 2f6bddd** — phone screenshot correction for trajectory visuals: remove the unintended gray BarChart tooltip cursor slab; add a visibly stronger semantic curve halo tied to the selected period's net realized P&L; add outcome-colored glow to Trade-by-Trade bars. Reduced-motion mode strips these extra filters.
- **039feeb / db90bd1** — follow-up device correction after user feedback: removing the slab exposed a selection-cue regression. Trade-by-Trade now highlights the actual active bar itself with its own semantic fill, bright outline, and stronger SVG-native halo. Regular bars also use SVG-native glow instead of CSS-only drop-shadow, avoiding the iPhone/Recharts rendering issue.
- **00d0a3a** — correct reduced-motion handling: static semantic chart glow remains visible; reduced-motion now suppresses movement/transition rather than erasing financial-state styling.
- User device validation accepted **Passes 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3**; those passes are now closed.
- **60460fc / ac124fc** — start Pass 7.4 with deterministic allocation identity colors and tests; the same holding/sector keeps its color across rank changes, while cash uses the reserved purple family.
- **905c850 / d8ae6e5 / a633d2a** — migrate Portfolio Allocation to the Phase 7 system: linked donut/list selection, always-visible center summary, segment-specific tooltip semantics, active segment outline/glow, stable colored list dots/progress bars, touch/keyboard row interaction, and reduced-motion-safe transitions. Allocation math, sector/holding tabs, and cash inclusion behavior are unchanged.
- **e09ee2c / df574e9 / bbfdafc / 366c0e2** — phone validation correction for 7.4: remove the hard-coded white selected-slice outline and drive selected slice + ranked-row border/glow from the allocation item's own semantic color. Ranked rows now use the shared semantic RGB halo variables; selected donut slices use native SVG semantic glow for iPhone reliability. Replace the Cash included/excluded selector with a compact premium iPhone-style `role="switch"` control while preserving the same include-cash state logic.
- **e08d8d1 / 0b897c6** — phone correction for the new cash switch: replace the fixed 3px vertical offset with true 50% geometric centering; preserve the same horizontal slide in both states.
- User accepted **Pass 7.4 Portfolio Allocation** after the semantic selection, cash-switch, and centering corrections; Pass 7.4 is closed.
- **2112984 / 8ddec6e / dc22a76 / 4de11d7 / b790421** — start Pass 7.5 shared responsive/accessibility hardening: viewport-clamped tooltip wrappers, narrow-phone tooltip fixes, chart aria descriptions, non-truncating legends, and accessible allocation selection announcements.
- **8574030 / 73b78bc / 56315b7 / 0093981 / ed0e852** — wire Recharts series to the user's actual `prefers-reduced-motion` setting. Full 520ms chart motion remains on normal devices; only explicit reduced-motion users skip series animation and 1W morphing.
- **6590f85 / dfa049c** — finish phone interaction rules: long primary tooltip values wrap, chart rails get contained touch scrolling, coarse-pointer chart controls reach 44px targets, 320–359px tooltip/axis density is tightened, short-landscape plot height is capped, and focus-visible states are explicit.
- **fe5970e / 327acbc / 5c39f32 / 4f1f8c8 / 1e2ec71** — finish Pass 7.5 interaction/accessibility corrections: chart summaries are explicitly wired through `aria-describedby`, the primary comparison series also honors reduced motion, mode/menu controls receive the same coarse-pointer touch sizing, horizontal chart rails preserve vertical page scroll, and trajectory/allocation tooltips now dismiss on outside tap just like the synchronized main/secondary analytics tooltips.
- Quality Checks **#763 passed** for the complete Pass 7.5 state: typecheck, **29/29 test files / 185/185 tests**, production build **4.96s**. Device validation remains pending.
- **38b774f / 8f0dbde / 82c5bc0 / 4357764 / ec873ab** — Pass 7.5 phone/landscape feedback correction: standardize main analytics, trajectory, and allocation segmented selectors on the existing Transactions/report selector shell + pill language; apply compact sizing to all canonical selector-shell controls; move chart scrolling outside the selector shell so semantic glow is not visibly clipped; add a short-landscape header mode that collapses metadata/action labels and prevents the action rail from wrapping into a clipped second row.
- **4f5d327 / f917f8e / e2afc93 / aff2366** — final short-landscape gutter correction: opt the PWA into `viewport-fit=cover` so the header/background can fill iPhone landscape safe areas, while safe-area-aware header/nav/main padding keeps interactive content clear of the display cutout.
- **118a53b / 8515214** — start Pass 7.6 regression/closure with deterministic guards for the full-width 1W transition geometry and the iPhone landscape viewport/safe-area contract.
- **0efd71f / 864166a** — portrait safe-area follow-up after device validation: keep `viewport-fit=cover`, but add a portrait-only `premium-header-safe-top` zone equal to `env(safe-area-inset-top) + 0.5rem` so controls start below the Dynamic Island/status area while the header glass still paints behind it. Landscape remains unchanged.
- Closure gate **#765 failed only at TypeScript** in the newly added weekly interpolation regression test because a readonly frame was cast to a mutable array. **5dd4ede / 4785484** correct the test typing and extend viewport regression coverage to the new portrait safe-top contract.
- Closure gate **#766** passed typecheck but exposed a fixture bug in the new weekly-transition regression test: the test accidentally omitted three outgoing points and duplicated matched points, so it asserted against an invalid profile. **470e90b** fixes the fixture to model the complete outgoing profile without changing production interpolation.
- **572fc5f** — add `docs/PHASE8_VISUAL_HIERARCHY_PLAN.md`, defining the H0–H5 hierarchy model and Passes 8.0–8.7. Phase 8 planning is complete but implementation waits for a clean Phase 7 closure gate.
- Quality Checks **#767 passed** the final Phase 7 closure state: typecheck, **31/31 test files / 190/190 tests**, production build **6.01s**. User device verification is accepted; **Phase 7 is closed**.
- Phase 8 planning is now active/ready: H0–H5 hierarchy model plus Passes **8.0–8.7** covering hierarchy primitives, Overview, Reports, dense workflows, typography/spacing, action priority, responsive hierarchy, and final regression.
- **f9cb332 / 2680534 / dc9c7e1** — implement Phase 8.0 hierarchy foundation: type-safe H0–H5 surface primitives, six typography roles, hierarchy spacing tokens, semantic-intensity separation, and action-priority classes plus regression tests.
- **540bb8c** — add the full Phase 8 hierarchy audit map for Overview, Reports, dense workflows, report submodules, modals, and the Header deferral boundary. 8.0 intentionally does not restyle screen content yet; 8.1 is the first visual migration.
- Quality Checks **#768 passed** the Phase 8.0 foundation.
- **0f968c9 / 4e8fd10 / 780f82e** — implement Pass 8.1 Overview hierarchy: Total Portfolio Value becomes the sole H1 hero with Today state integrated inside it; Unrealized P&L and Market Value become H2; Realized Gain, Cash, and Fees become H3; the Live Market Feed moves below the financial summary and becomes H4 utility context; sync/reconcile actions are visually de-emphasized. Add regression coverage for hierarchy counts, reading order, and utility priority.
- Quality Checks **#769 passed** Pass 8.1: **33/33 test files, 196/196 tests**, production build **5.13s**.
- **3d5ac37 / 1fc31cb / 0710fb2 / 583333f / 1d2fd1a / 54d53e7 / bbffa24 / 6fe04d7 / a802b70** — implement Pass 8.2 Reports composition hierarchy: structural page intro, consolidated H3 report summary band, main analytics as sole H1, supporting charts/trajectory/allocation as H2, bridge/closed summary as H3, metric/detail insets as H4, and flattened structural H0 wrappers for Trading Performance + Monthly Performance. Older report-glass intensity is explicitly overridden so nested visual weight is actually reduced without touching Phase 7 behavior.
- Quality Checks **#770 passed** Pass 8.2: **34/34 test files, 200/200 tests**, production build **6.24s**.
- **d73ec82 / 42fb7ac / 43035ff / 10ad620 / edb9e33 / 5cb9563 / 2a765f4** — implement Pass 8.3 dense workflow hierarchy across Positions, Closed Cycles, Transactions, Cash Ledger, and Stocks. Summary/context stays H2/H3, controls become H4, table/list data becomes H5. All workflow behavior remains unchanged; regression coverage locks the summary → controls → dense-data contract.
- **8d209b6 / 063a3db / 32ad28d / b74b975** — semantic-soul correction after device review: Phase 8 hierarchy rules had been overriding the Phase 5 semantic halo and H5 near/far alpha had been zeroed. Restore hierarchy-aware H1/H2/H3 semantic auras, restore amber cost glow to Brokerage Fees, and change H5 repeated semantic records to edge cue + restrained near/far aura + shallow interior wash. Tests now explicitly prevent hierarchy from erasing semantic atmosphere.
- **857a69b / 677737e / 0d83281 / 8e65836 / f308f00 / ec581e2 / 65ff7cc / 0756123** — semantic/glass restoration v2 after device review showed the first correction was still too weak. Restore the actual pre-Phase-8 glass/refraction recipes, restore `premium-hero-card` to Total Portfolio Value, restore `premium-glass` to summary/context bands, remove H2/H3/H5 semantic attenuation, give all semantic cards the full accepted halo, and preserve compact semantic glow on H4/report state surfaces. Hierarchy is now geometry/type/grouping only; accepted visual primitives are protected.
- **85b4bfe / 33982c2 / 2fd17f3** — visual-language hard reset after a second device review showed restoration v2 still read as opaque navy + colored border on iPhone. Force the accepted hero-grade report glass at the end of the cascade: stronger translucent white top layer, 24–26px blur, 150–165% saturation, hero-tier refraction, semantic interior bloom, and full near/far halo on every semantic card. Dense semantic cards keep the halo and add the left semantic edge only as an extra cue. Mobile explicitly retains full halo strength. Tests now lock the glass + halo recipe itself, not merely class presence.
- **86fb143 / 837eb38 / adaf7a1 / 1f0bf14 / bc04b86 / 1630d39 / d5c4f1e / 1615127 / 57b8396 / 4b0115c / 7b25deb / c0cbacf / bdab5c8 / 2ed899a / da700ff** — replace the failed patch chain with the canonical three-axis visual language. Remove all Phase-8 H-level material/glow overrides and all emergency semantic restoration blocks; H0–H5 are now material-agnostic. Preserve the accepted pre-Phase-8 material primitives, add exactly three semantic roles (hero/card/record), remap Overview and dense financial records to those roles, restore accepted report/workflow glass primitives, and codify the protected architecture in `docs/PREMIUM_VISUAL_LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md`. This entry supersedes the earlier Phase-8 glow-repair strategies above.
- Quality Checks **#775 passed** the canonical visual-language state: typecheck, **36/36 test files / 210/210 tests**, production build **6.40s**. Device visual validation remains the acceptance gate.
- Quality Checks **#753 passed** for the trajectory device correction.
- **cb08cd9 / bd33174** — resume **Pass 7.2 Secondary Analytics**: Drawdown, Cumulative Fees, and Realized vs Unrealized now use the shared inset plot system, semantic card/plot accents, stronger luminous series, shared active-point/reference-line/margin formatting, and explicit Realized vs Unrealized legend hierarchy. Drawdown remains rose/risk, Fees remains amber/cost, and P&L composition uses sign-aware semantic colors with solid Realized vs dashed Unrealized identity. Data, syncId, Today/daily curve rules, fee stepAfter behavior, tooltip synchronization, and 520ms timing are unchanged. Quality Checks **#754 passed**: typecheck, **29/29 test files / 182/182 tests**, production build **4.85s**. Device visual validation remains pending.
- **ab8aa8a** — fix Realized vs Unrealized tooltip labels after phone validation: Recharts already provides the explicit Line names (`Realized` / `Unrealized`); remove the incorrect formatter that compared those names against raw data keys and therefore mislabeled both rows as Unrealized.
- **0a24aa8 / 083ee36 / 8da025d** — fix persistent mobile analytics tooltips. Main + secondary charts now share tooltip-dismiss state: a page press outside chart surfaces closes all synchronized tooltips, and the next chart interaction re-enables them without changing chart data or sync behavior.

## Current validated visual rules

- Realized P&L / Portfolio Allocation segmented language is the default selector family.
- Add Trade / Open Position primary actions remain intentionally distinct.
- Hero cards outrank secondary/inset cards.
- Reports use the same hierarchy as dashboard cards.
- Dropdowns are true overlays.
- Selected selector state is immediately visible, including while hovered.
- Button/selector glow matches semantic color.
- Modal families share shell, grouping, fields, actions, and close-control language.
- Phase 4 follows the approved five-family motion system; new motion must map to one of those families.

## Quality / CI

The branch uses **.github/workflows/quality.yml** (“Quality Checks”).

Every visual phase should continue to pass the repository’s existing typecheck/tests/build gates. Phase 11 performs the final dedicated regression, accessibility, and performance audit.

## Updating this log

Documentation is maintained continuously with implementation work. Do not wait for a separate user request.

Whenever a phase or meaningful pass changes the accepted design state:
1. Update the status table immediately.
2. Summarize actual implementation, not only intended scope.
3. Add representative commit SHAs.
4. Record any approved visual-only exception, rollback, restoration, or deferred debt.
5. Record user-validation findings that changed implementation.
6. Keep the roadmap/next-phase state synchronized with the plan.
7. Do not mark a phase complete until the plan acceptance criteria are met.
