# Phase 6.5 — Navigation Refinement Plan

**Status: COMPLETE — phone validation accepted; Pass 3 hardening + Quality Checks #748 clean. Desktop visual regression remains scheduled for Phase 11.**

Phase 6.5 refines navigation only. It preserves the accepted premium glass/glow system and the Phase 4 motion language while making location, grouping, and overflow behavior clearer across desktop and mobile.

## Boundaries

- Presentation/navigation architecture only.
- No portfolio/accounting/transaction/persistence/market-data behavior changes.
- Do not perform the final Header redesign here; Phase 9 still owns final utility/header composition.
- Do not redesign charts; Phase 7 owns chart visuals.
- Preserve the seven existing destinations and their route/tab behavior.
- Preserve Phase 6 responsive/touch contracts.

## Pass 1 — Main navigation architecture

- Replace duplicated tab markup with one canonical navigation definition.
- Group destinations by task without adding another heavy visual bar:
  - Portfolio: Overview, Positions, Closed Cycles.
  - Activity: Transactions, Cash Ledger.
  - Insights: Reports & Performance, Stocks & Prices.
- Make active location materially clearer than hover/inactive states.
- Keep icons and semantic accent identity.
- Keep the selected tab automatically visible after navigation.
- Add left/right overflow fades so phone users can see when more destinations exist.
- Keep the nav compact enough that it does not compete with portfolio content.

## Pass 2 — Mobile/desktop handoff

**Status: IMPLEMENTED — awaiting device/desktop validation.**

Implemented:
- **070db8b / fa495c4** — keep compact labels below 2XL, move explicit group labels to 2XL only, reduce phone tab padding/gap pressure, and preserve full destination labels at 2XL.
- Add roving keyboard focus across navigation: Left/Right arrows move between destinations; Home/End jump to first/last; Enter/Space preserve normal button activation.
- Active-tab auto-scroll now respects `prefers-reduced-motion` instead of always forcing smooth scrolling.
- **fefd19f** — make navigation overflow feedback geometry-driven at every breakpoint; remove the old 1280px rule that hid fades regardless of actual overflow.
- Add proximity scroll-snap and mobile scroll padding so touch scrolling settles around useful tab positions without forcing hard snapping.
- Preserve the accepted stronger group separator from Pass 1 correction.

Deferred:
- Phone tab/page transition timing is improved but **not considered final**. User accepted moving forward while explicitly requesting deeper transition work later. Treat this as motion debt for a later motion/performance refinement pass, not as a closed 6.5 acceptance item.

Validation targets:
- phone/tablet label density;
- edge fades appear/disappear only when content is actually hidden;
- keyboard focus does not alter active tab until activation;
- reduced-motion has no smooth auto-scroll;
- sticky header/nav/content handoff stays stable without pulling Phase 9 work forward.

## Pass 3 — Validation and closure

**Status: COMPLETE.**

Completed:
- **b830803** — replace generic `scrollIntoView` with rail-local geometry scrolling so active-tab visibility cannot move the page itself; preserve reduced-motion behavior.
- Keep every navigation destination in the normal keyboard tab order while retaining Left/Right/Home/End shortcuts.
- Add explicit navigation-group semantics without changing routing behavior.
- Phone validation: active-state hierarchy accepted; strengthened group separator accepted; horizontal navigation behavior retained.
- Static breakpoint audit: compact labels below 2XL, full labels/group labels at 2XL, geometry-driven overflow fades at every breakpoint.
- Temporary CI gate: `ci/phase6-5-nav-pass3-gate`.
- **Quality Checks #748 passed**:
  - typecheck passed;
  - **28/28 test files, 173/173 tests** passed;
  - production build passed in **6.18s**.

Closure notes:
- Current phone tab/page transition timing remains intentionally **non-final** and is recorded as deferred motion debt for later refinement.
- A dedicated physical desktop/tablet visual smoke was not available during this closure; final desktop/browser visual regression remains part of Phase 11 rather than blocking navigation architecture completion.

## Acceptance

- Current location is obvious at a glance.
- Inactive destinations remain discoverable without competing with the active page.
- Navigation grouping is understandable without visual clutter.
- Mobile horizontal overflow advertises itself and never hides the selected destination.
- No navigation-driven page-level horizontal movement; final physical desktop/tablet collision smoke remains in Phase 11.
- Existing tab routing behavior remains unchanged; transition timing currently carries documented deferred motion debt.
